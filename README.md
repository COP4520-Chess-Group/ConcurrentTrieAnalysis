## Warnings
I recommend against string lengths of over 50 and a number of items over 1 million. These values just make the memory size so large that force killing the process is really the only option.
## Compile and Run
First and foremost, make sure that you have the JDK installed as well as a JRE.

You can clone the repo by running the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/COP4520-Chess-Group/ConcurrentTrieAnalysis```

Once this is done, just run the `build.bat` file in the home directory, then move on to running the program.

If you are on Linux or Mac, you can use `build.sh` instead.

This program has some arguments involved, in general the syntax for running the program is 
`java -jar build\Project.jar`.
