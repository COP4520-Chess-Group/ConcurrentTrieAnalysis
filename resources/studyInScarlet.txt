CHAPTER
I.
MR.
SHERLOCK
HOLMES.

IN
the
year
1878
I
took
my
degree
of
Doctor
of
Medicine
of
the
University
of
London,
and
proceeded
to
Netley
to
go
through
the
course
prescribed
for
surgeons
in
the
army.
Having
completed
my
studies
there,
I
was
duly
attached
to
the
Fifth
Northumberland
Fusiliers
as
Assistant
Surgeon.
The
regiment
was
stationed
in
India
at
the
time,
and
before
I
could
join
it,
the
second
Afghan
war
had
broken
out.
On
landing
at
Bombay,
I
learned
that
my
corps
had
advanced
through
the
passes,
and
was
already
deep
in
the
enemy’s
country.
I
followed,
however,
with
many
other
officers
who
were
in
the
same
situation
as
myself,
and
succeeded
in
reaching
Candahar
in
safety,
where
I
found
my
regiment,
and
at
once
entered
upon
my
new
duties.

The
campaign
brought
honours
and
promotion
to
many,
but
for
me
it
had
nothing
but
misfortune
and
disaster.
I
was
removed
from
my
brigade
and
attached
to
the
Berkshires,
with
whom
I
served
at
the
fatal
battle
of
Maiwand.
There
I
was
struck
on
the
shoulder
by
a
Jezail
bullet,
which
shattered
the
bone
and
grazed
the
subclavian
artery.
I
should
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
murderous
Ghazis
had
it
not
been
for
the
devotion
and
courage
shown
by
Murray,
my
orderly,
who
threw
me
across
a
pack-horse,
and
succeeded
in
bringing
me
safely
to
the
British
lines.

Worn
with
pain,
and
weak
from
the
prolonged
hardships
which
I
had
undergone,
I
was
removed,
with
a
great
train
of
wounded
sufferers,
to
the
base
hospital
at
Peshawar.
Here
I
rallied,
and
had
already
improved
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
walk
about
the
wards,
and
even
to
bask
a
little
upon
the
verandah,
when
I
was
struck
down
by
enteric
fever,
that
curse
of
our
Indian
possessions.
For
months
my
life
was
despaired
of,
and
when
at
last
I
came
to
myself
and
became
convalescent,
I
was
so
weak
and
emaciated
that
a
medical
board
determined
that
not
a
day
should
be
lost
in
sending
me
back
to
England.
I
was
dispatched,
accordingly,
in
the
troopship
“Orontes,”
and
landed
a
month
later
on
Portsmouth
jetty,
with
my
health
irretrievably
ruined,
but
with
permission
from
a
paternal
government
to
spend
the
next
nine
months
in
attempting
to
improve
it.

I
had
neither
kith
nor
kin
in
England,
and
was
therefore
as
free
as
air—or
as
free
as
an
income
of
eleven
shillings
and
sixpence
a
day
will
permit
a
man
to
be.
Under
such
circumstances,
I
naturally
gravitated
to
London,
that
great
cesspool
into
which
all
the
loungers
and
idlers
of
the
Empire
are
irresistibly
drained.
There
I
stayed
for
some
time
at
a
private
hotel
in
the
Strand,
leading
a
comfortless,
meaningless
existence,
and
spending
such
money
as
I
had,
considerably
more
freely
than
I
ought.
So
alarming
did
the
state
of
my
finances
become,
that
I
soon
realized
that
I
must
either
leave
the
metropolis
and
rusticate
somewhere
in
the
country,
or
that
I
must
make
a
complete
alteration
in
my
style
of
living.
Choosing
the
latter
alternative,
I
began
by
making
up
my
mind
to
leave
the
hotel,
and
to
take
up
my
quarters
in
some
less
pretentious
and
less
expensive
domicile.

On
the
very
day
that
I
had
come
to
this
conclusion,
I
was
standing
at
the
Criterion
Bar,
when
some
one
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder,
and
turning
round
I
recognized
young
Stamford,
who
had
been
a
dresser
under
me
at
Barts.
The
sight
of
a
friendly
face
in
the
great
wilderness
of
London
is
a
pleasant
thing
indeed
to
a
lonely
man.
In
old
days
Stamford
had
never
been
a
particular
crony
of
mine,
but
now
I
hailed
him
with
enthusiasm,
and
he,
in
his
turn,
appeared
to
be
delighted
to
see
me.
In
the
exuberance
of
my
joy,
I
asked
him
to
lunch
with
me
at
the
Holborn,
and
we
started
off
together
in
a
hansom.

“Whatever
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself,
Watson?”
he
asked
in
undisguised
wonder,
as
we
rattled
through
the
crowded
London
streets.
“You
are
as
thin
as
a
lath
and
as
brown
as
a
nut.”

I
gave
him
a
short
sketch
of
my
adventures,
and
had
hardly
concluded
it
by
the
time
that
we
reached
our
destination.

“Poor
devil!”
he
said,
commiseratingly,
after
he
had
listened
to
my
misfortunes.
“What
are
you
up
to
now?”

“Looking
for
lodgings.”
3
I
answered.
“Trying
to
solve
the
problem
as
to
whether
it
is
possible
to
get
comfortable
rooms
at
a
reasonable
price.”

“That’s
a
strange
thing,”
remarked
my
companion;
“you
are
the
second
man
to-day
that
has
used
that
expression
to
me.”

“And
who
was
the
first?”
I
asked.

“A
fellow
who
is
working
at
the
chemical
laboratory
up
at
the
hospital.
He
was
bemoaning
himself
this
morning
because
he
could
not
get
someone
to
go
halves
with
him
in
some
nice
rooms
which
he
had
found,
and
which
were
too
much
for
his
purse.”

“By
Jove!”
I
cried,
“if
he
really
wants
someone
to
share
the
rooms
and
the
expense,
I
am
the
very
man
for
him.
I
should
prefer
having
a
partner
to
being
alone.”

Young
Stamford
looked
rather
strangely
at
me
over
his
wine-glass.
“You
don’t
know
Sherlock
Holmes
yet,”
he
said;
“perhaps
you
would
not
care
for
him
as
a
constant
companion.”

“Why,
what
is
there
against
him?”

“Oh,
I
didn’t
say
there
was
anything
against
him.
He
is
a
little
queer
in
his
ideas—an
enthusiast
in
some
branches
of
science.
As
far
as
I
know
he
is
a
decent
fellow
enough.”

“A
medical
student,
I
suppose?”
said
I.

“No—I
have
no
idea
what
he
intends
to
go
in
for.
I
believe
he
is
well
up
in
anatomy,
and
he
is
a
first-class
chemist;
but,
as
far
as
I
know,
he
has
never
taken
out
any
systematic
medical
classes.
His
studies
are
very
desultory
and
eccentric,
but
he
has
amassed
a
lot
of
out-of-the
way
knowledge
which
would
astonish
his
professors.”

“Did
you
never
ask
him
what
he
was
going
in
for?”
I
asked.

“No;
he
is
not
a
man
that
it
is
easy
to
draw
out,
though
he
can
be
communicative
enough
when
the
fancy
seizes
him.”

“I
should
like
to
meet
him,”
I
said.
“If
I
am
to
lodge
with
anyone,
I
should
prefer
a
man
of
studious
and
quiet
habits.
I
am
not
strong
enough
yet
to
stand
much
noise
or
excitement.
I
had
enough
of
both
in
Afghanistan
to
last
me
for
the
remainder
of
my
natural
existence.
How
could
I
meet
this
friend
of
yours?”

“He
is
sure
to
be
at
the
laboratory,”
returned
my
companion.
“He
either
avoids
the
place
for
weeks,
or
else
he
works
there
from
morning
to
night.
If
you
like,
we
shall
drive
round
together
after
luncheon.”

“Certainly,”
I
answered,
and
the
conversation
drifted
away
into
other
channels.

As
we
made
our
way
to
the
hospital
after
leaving
the
Holborn,
Stamford
gave
me
a
few
more
particulars
about
the
gentleman
whom
I
proposed
to
take
as
a
fellow-lodger.

“You
mustn’t
blame
me
if
you
don’t
get
on
with
him,”
he
said;
“I
know
nothing
more
of
him
than
I
have
learned
from
meeting
him
occasionally
in
the
laboratory.
You
proposed
this
arrangement,
so
you
must
not
hold
me
responsible.”

“If
we
don’t
get
on
it
will
be
easy
to
part
company,”
I
answered.
“It
seems
to
me,
Stamford,”
I
added,
looking
hard
at
my
companion,
“that
you
have
some
reason
for
washing
your
hands
of
the
matter.
Is
this
fellow’s
temper
so
formidable,
or
what
is
it?
Don’t
be
mealy-mouthed
about
it.”

“It
is
not
easy
to
express
the
inexpressible,”
he
answered
with
a
laugh.
“Holmes
is
a
little
too
scientific
for
my
tastes—it
approaches
to
cold-bloodedness.
I
could
imagine
his
giving
a
friend
a
little
pinch
of
the
latest
vegetable
alkaloid,
not
out
of
malevolence,
you
understand,
but
simply
out
of
a
spirit
of
inquiry
in
order
to
have
an
accurate
idea
of
the
effects.
To
do
him
justice,
I
think
that
he
would
take
it
himself
with
the
same
readiness.
He
appears
to
have
a
passion
for
definite
and
exact
knowledge.”

“Very
right
too.”

“Yes,
but
it
may
be
pushed
to
excess.
When
it
comes
to
beating
the
subjects
in
the
dissecting-rooms
with
a
stick,
it
is
certainly
taking
rather
a
bizarre
shape.”

“Beating
the
subjects!”

“Yes,
to
verify
how
far
bruises
may
be
produced
after
death.
I
saw
him
at
it
with
my
own
eyes.”

“And
yet
you
say
he
is
not
a
medical
student?”

“No.
Heaven
knows
what
the
objects
of
his
studies
are.
But
here
we
are,
and
you
must
form
your
own
impressions
about
him.”
As
he
spoke,
we
turned
down
a
narrow
lane
and
passed
through
a
small
side-door,
which
opened
into
a
wing
of
the
great
hospital.
It
was
familiar
ground
to
me,
and
I
needed
no
guiding
as
we
ascended
the
bleak
stone
staircase
and
made
our
way
down
the
long
corridor
with
its
vista
of
whitewashed
wall
and
dun-coloured
doors.
Near
the
further
end
a
low
arched
passage
branched
away
from
it
and
led
to
the
chemical
laboratory.

This
was
a
lofty
chamber,
lined
and
littered
with
countless
bottles.
Broad,
low
tables
were
scattered
about,
which
bristled
with
retorts,
test-tubes,
and
little
Bunsen
lamps,
with
their
blue
flickering
flames.
There
was
only
one
student
in
the
room,
who
was
bending
over
a
distant
table
absorbed
in
his
work.
At
the
sound
of
our
steps
he
glanced
round
and
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
pleasure.
“I’ve
found
it!
I’ve
found
it,”
he
shouted
to
my
companion,
running
towards
us
with
a
test-tube
in
his
hand.
“I
have
found
a
re-agent
which
is
precipitated
by
hoemoglobin,
4
and
by
nothing
else.”
Had
he
discovered
a
gold
mine,
greater
delight
could
not
have
shone
upon
his
features.

“Dr.
Watson,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,”
said
Stamford,
introducing
us.

“How
are
you?”
he
said
cordially,
gripping
my
hand
with
a
strength
for
which
I
should
hardly
have
given
him
credit.
“You
have
been
in
Afghanistan,
I
perceive.”

“How
on
earth
did
you
know
that?”
I
asked
in
astonishment.

“Never
mind,”
said
he,
chuckling
to
himself.
“The
question
now
is
about
hoemoglobin.
No
doubt
you
see
the
significance
of
this
discovery
of
mine?”

“It
is
interesting,
chemically,
no
doubt,”
I
answered,
“but
practically——”

“Why,
man,
it
is
the
most
practical
medico-legal
discovery
for
years.
Don’t
you
see
that
it
gives
us
an
infallible
test
for
blood
stains.
Come
over
here
now!”
He
seized
me
by
the
coat-sleeve
in
his
eagerness,
and
drew
me
over
to
the
table
at
which
he
had
been
working.
“Let
us
have
some
fresh
blood,”
he
said,
digging
a
long
bodkin
into
his
finger,
and
drawing
off
the
resulting
drop
of
blood
in
a
chemical
pipette.
“Now,
I
add
this
small
quantity
of
blood
to
a
litre
of
water.
You
perceive
that
the
resulting
mixture
has
the
appearance
of
pure
water.
The
proportion
of
blood
cannot
be
more
than
one
in
a
million.
I
have
no
doubt,
however,
that
we
shall
be
able
to
obtain
the
characteristic
reaction.”
As
he
spoke,
he
threw
into
the
vessel
a
few
white
crystals,
and
then
added
some
drops
of
a
transparent
fluid.
In
an
instant
the
contents
assumed
a
dull
mahogany
colour,
and
a
brownish
dust
was
precipitated
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
jar.

“Ha!
ha!”
he
cried,
clapping
his
hands,
and
looking
as
delighted
as
a
child
with
a
new
toy.
“What
do
you
think
of
that?”

“It
seems
to
be
a
very
delicate
test,”
I
remarked.

“Beautiful!
beautiful!
The
old
Guiacum
test
was
very
clumsy
and
uncertain.
So
is
the
microscopic
examination
for
blood
corpuscles.
The
latter
is
valueless
if
the
stains
are
a
few
hours
old.
Now,
this
appears
to
act
as
well
whether
the
blood
is
old
or
new.
Had
this
test
been
invented,
there
are
hundreds
of
men
now
walking
the
earth
who
would
long
ago
have
paid
the
penalty
of
their
crimes.”

“Indeed!”
I
murmured.

“Criminal
cases
are
continually
hinging
upon
that
one
point.
A
man
is
suspected
of
a
crime
months
perhaps
after
it
has
been
committed.
His
linen
or
clothes
are
examined,
and
brownish
stains
discovered
upon
them.
Are
they
blood
stains,
or
mud
stains,
or
rust
stains,
or
fruit
stains,
or
what
are
they?
That
is
a
question
which
has
puzzled
many
an
expert,
and
why?
Because
there
was
no
reliable
test.
Now
we
have
the
Sherlock
Holmes’
test,
and
there
will
no
longer
be
any
difficulty.”

His
eyes
fairly
glittered
as
he
spoke,
and
he
put
his
hand
over
his
heart
and
bowed
as
if
to
some
applauding
crowd
conjured
up
by
his
imagination.

“You
are
to
be
congratulated,”
I
remarked,
considerably
surprised
at
his
enthusiasm.

“There
was
the
case
of
Von
Bischoff
at
Frankfort
last
year.
He
would
certainly
have
been
hung
had
this
test
been
in
existence.
Then
there
was
Mason
of
Bradford,
and
the
notorious
Muller,
and
Lefevre
of
Montpellier,
and
Samson
of
New
Orleans.
I
could
name
a
score
of
cases
in
which
it
would
have
been
decisive.”

“You
seem
to
be
a
walking
calendar
of
crime,”
said
Stamford
with
a
laugh.
“You
might
start
a
paper
on
those
lines.
Call
it
the
‘Police
News
of
the
Past.’”

“Very
interesting
reading
it
might
be
made,
too,”
remarked
Sherlock
Holmes,
sticking
a
small
piece
of
plaster
over
the
prick
on
his
finger.
“I
have
to
be
careful,”
he
continued,
turning
to
me
with
a
smile,
“for
I
dabble
with
poisons
a
good
deal.”
He
held
out
his
hand
as
he
spoke,
and
I
noticed
that
it
was
all
mottled
over
with
similar
pieces
of
plaster,
and
discoloured
with
strong
acids.

“We
came
here
on
business,”
said
Stamford,
sitting
down
on
a
high
three-legged
stool,
and
pushing
another
one
in
my
direction
with
his
foot.
“My
friend
here
wants
to
take
diggings,
and
as
you
were
complaining
that
you
could
get
no
one
to
go
halves
with
you,
I
thought
that
I
had
better
bring
you
together.”

Sherlock
Holmes
seemed
delighted
at
the
idea
of
sharing
his
rooms
with
me.
“I
have
my
eye
on
a
suite
in
Baker
Street,”
he
said,
“which
would
suit
us
down
to
the
ground.
You
don’t
mind
the
smell
of
strong
tobacco,
I
hope?”

“I
always
smoke
‘ship’s’
myself,”
I
answered.

“That’s
good
enough.
I
generally
have
chemicals
about,
and
occasionally
do
experiments.
Would
that
annoy
you?”

“By
no
means.”

“Let
me
see—what
are
my
other
shortcomings.
I
get
in
the
dumps
at
times,
and
don’t
open
my
mouth
for
days
on
end.
You
must
not
think
I
am
sulky
when
I
do
that.
Just
let
me
alone,
and
I’ll
soon
be
right.
What
have
you
to
confess
now?
It’s
just
as
well
for
two
fellows
to
know
the
worst
of
one
another
before
they
begin
to
live
together.”

I
laughed
at
this
cross-examination.
“I
keep
a
bull
pup,”
I
said,
“and
I
object
to
rows
because
my
nerves
are
shaken,
and
I
get
up
at
all
sorts
of
ungodly
hours,
and
I
am
extremely
lazy.
I
have
another
set
of
vices
when
I’m
well,
but
those
are
the
principal
ones
at
present.”

“Do
you
include
violin-playing
in
your
category
of
rows?”
he
asked,
anxiously.

“It
depends
on
the
player,”
I
answered.
“A
well-played
violin
is
a
treat
for
the
gods—a
badly-played
one——”

“Oh,
that’s
all
right,”
he
cried,
with
a
merry
laugh.
“I
think
we
may
consider
the
thing
as
settled—that
is,
if
the
rooms
are
agreeable
to
you.”

“When
shall
we
see
them?”

“Call
for
me
here
at
noon
to-morrow,
and
we’ll
go
together
and
settle
everything,”
he
answered.

“All
right—noon
exactly,”
said
I,
shaking
his
hand.

We
left
him
working
among
his
chemicals,
and
we
walked
together
towards
my
hotel.

“By
the
way,”
I
asked
suddenly,
stopping
and
turning
upon
Stamford,
“how
the
deuce
did
he
know
that
I
had
come
from
Afghanistan?”

My
companion
smiled
an
enigmatical
smile.
“That’s
just
his
little
peculiarity,”
he
said.
“A
good
many
people
have
wanted
to
know
how
he
finds
things
out.”

“Oh!
a
mystery
is
it?”
I
cried,
rubbing
my
hands.
“This
is
very
piquant.
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
bringing
us
together.
‘The
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man,’
you
know.”

“You
must
study
him,
then,”
Stamford
said,
as
he
bade
me
good-bye.
“You’ll
find
him
a
knotty
problem,
though.
I’ll
wager
he
learns
more
about
you
than
you
about
him.
Good-bye.”

“Good-bye,”
I
answered,
and
strolled
on
to
my
hotel,
considerably
interested
in
my
new
acquaintance.





CHAPTER
II.
THE
SCIENCE
OF
DEDUCTION.

WE
met
next
day
as
he
had
arranged,
and
inspected
the
rooms
at
No.
221B,
5
Baker
Street,
of
which
he
had
spoken
at
our
meeting.
They
consisted
of
a
couple
of
comfortable
bed-rooms
and
a
single
large
airy
sitting-room,
cheerfully
furnished,
and
illuminated
by
two
broad
windows.
So
desirable
in
every
way
were
the
apartments,
and
so
moderate
did
the
terms
seem
when
divided
between
us,
that
the
bargain
was
concluded
upon
the
spot,
and
we
at
once
entered
into
possession.
That
very
evening
I
moved
my
things
round
from
the
hotel,
and
on
the
following
morning
Sherlock
Holmes
followed
me
with
several
boxes
and
portmanteaus.
For
a
day
or
two
we
were
busily
employed
in
unpacking
and
laying
out
our
property
to
the
best
advantage.
That
done,
we
gradually
began
to
settle
down
and
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
our
new
surroundings.

Holmes
was
certainly
not
a
difficult
man
to
live
with.
He
was
quiet
in
his
ways,
and
his
habits
were
regular.
It
was
rare
for
him
to
be
up
after
ten
at
night,
and
he
had
invariably
breakfasted
and
gone
out
before
I
rose
in
the
morning.
Sometimes
he
spent
his
day
at
the
chemical
laboratory,
sometimes
in
the
dissecting-rooms,
and
occasionally
in
long
walks,
which
appeared
to
take
him
into
the
lowest
portions
of
the
City.
Nothing
could
exceed
his
energy
when
the
working
fit
was
upon
him;
but
now
and
again
a
reaction
would
seize
him,
and
for
days
on
end
he
would
lie
upon
the
sofa
in
the
sitting-room,
hardly
uttering
a
word
or
moving
a
muscle
from
morning
to
night.
On
these
occasions
I
have
noticed
such
a
dreamy,
vacant
expression
in
his
eyes,
that
I
might
have
suspected
him
of
being
addicted
to
the
use
of
some
narcotic,
had
not
the
temperance
and
cleanliness
of
his
whole
life
forbidden
such
a
notion.

As
the
weeks
went
by,
my
interest
in
him
and
my
curiosity
as
to
his
aims
in
life,
gradually
deepened
and
increased.
His
very
person
and
appearance
were
such
as
to
strike
the
attention
of
the
most
casual
observer.
In
height
he
was
rather
over
six
feet,
and
so
excessively
lean
that
he
seemed
to
be
considerably
taller.
His
eyes
were
sharp
and
piercing,
save
during
those
intervals
of
torpor
to
which
I
have
alluded;
and
his
thin,
hawk-like
nose
gave
his
whole
expression
an
air
of
alertness
and
decision.
His
chin,
too,
had
the
prominence
and
squareness
which
mark
the
man
of
determination.
His
hands
were
invariably
blotted
with
ink
and
stained
with
chemicals,
yet
he
was
possessed
of
extraordinary
delicacy
of
touch,
as
I
frequently
had
occasion
to
observe
when
I
watched
him
manipulating
his
fragile
philosophical
instruments.

The
reader
may
set
me
down
as
a
hopeless
busybody,
when
I
confess
how
much
this
man
stimulated
my
curiosity,
and
how
often
I
endeavoured
to
break
through
the
reticence
which
he
showed
on
all
that
concerned
himself.
Before
pronouncing
judgment,
however,
be
it
remembered,
how
objectless
was
my
life,
and
how
little
there
was
to
engage
my
attention.
My
health
forbade
me
from
venturing
out
unless
the
weather
was
exceptionally
genial,
and
I
had
no
friends
who
would
call
upon
me
and
break
the
monotony
of
my
daily
existence.
Under
these
circumstances,
I
eagerly
hailed
the
little
mystery
which
hung
around
my
companion,
and
spent
much
of
my
time
in
endeavouring
to
unravel
it.

He
was
not
studying
medicine.
He
had
himself,
in
reply
to
a
question,
confirmed
Stamford’s
opinion
upon
that
point.
Neither
did
he
appear
to
have
pursued
any
course
of
reading
which
might
fit
him
for
a
degree
in
science
or
any
other
recognized
portal
which
would
give
him
an
entrance
into
the
learned
world.
Yet
his
zeal
for
certain
studies
was
remarkable,
and
within
eccentric
limits
his
knowledge
was
so
extraordinarily
ample
and
minute
that
his
observations
have
fairly
astounded
me.
Surely
no
man
would
work
so
hard
or
attain
such
precise
information
unless
he
had
some
definite
end
in
view.
Desultory
readers
are
seldom
remarkable
for
the
exactness
of
their
learning.
No
man
burdens
his
mind
with
small
matters
unless
he
has
some
very
good
reason
for
doing
so.

His
ignorance
was
as
remarkable
as
his
knowledge.
Of
contemporary
literature,
philosophy
and
politics
he
appeared
to
know
next
to
nothing.
Upon
my
quoting
Thomas
Carlyle,
he
inquired
in
the
naivest
way
who
he
might
be
and
what
he
had
done.
My
surprise
reached
a
climax,
however,
when
I
found
incidentally
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
Copernican
Theory
and
of
the
composition
of
the
Solar
System.
That
any
civilized
human
being
in
this
nineteenth
century
should
not
be
aware
that
the
earth
travelled
round
the
sun
appeared
to
be
to
me
such
an
extraordinary
fact
that
I
could
hardly
realize
it.

“You
appear
to
be
astonished,”
he
said,
smiling
at
my
expression
of
surprise.
“Now
that
I
do
know
it
I
shall
do
my
best
to
forget
it.”

“To
forget
it!”

“You
see,”
he
explained,
“I
consider
that
a
man’s
brain
originally
is
like
a
little
empty
attic,
and
you
have
to
stock
it
with
such
furniture
as
you
choose.
A
fool
takes
in
all
the
lumber
of
every
sort
that
he
comes
across,
so
that
the
knowledge
which
might
be
useful
to
him
gets
crowded
out,
or
at
best
is
jumbled
up
with
a
lot
of
other
things
so
that
he
has
a
difficulty
in
laying
his
hands
upon
it.
Now
the
skilful
workman
is
very
careful
indeed
as
to
what
he
takes
into
his
brain-attic.
He
will
have
nothing
but
the
tools
which
may
help
him
in
doing
his
work,
but
of
these
he
has
a
large
assortment,
and
all
in
the
most
perfect
order.
It
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
that
little
room
has
elastic
walls
and
can
distend
to
any
extent.
Depend
upon
it
there
comes
a
time
when
for
every
addition
of
knowledge
you
forget
something
that
you
knew
before.
It
is
of
the
highest
importance,
therefore,
not
to
have
useless
facts
elbowing
out
the
useful
ones.”

“But
the
Solar
System!”
I
protested.

“What
the
deuce
is
it
to
me?”
he
interrupted
impatiently;
“you
say
that
we
go
round
the
sun.
If
we
went
round
the
moon
it
would
not
make
a
pennyworth
of
difference
to
me
or
to
my
work.”

I
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
what
that
work
might
be,
but
something
in
his
manner
showed
me
that
the
question
would
be
an
unwelcome
one.
I
pondered
over
our
short
conversation,
however,
and
endeavoured
to
draw
my
deductions
from
it.
He
said
that
he
would
acquire
no
knowledge
which
did
not
bear
upon
his
object.
Therefore
all
the
knowledge
which
he
possessed
was
such
as
would
be
useful
to
him.
I
enumerated
in
my
own
mind
all
the
various
points
upon
which
he
had
shown
me
that
he
was
exceptionally
well-informed.
I
even
took
a
pencil
and
jotted
them
down.
I
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
document
when
I
had
completed
it.
It
ran
in
this
way—

SHERLOCK
HOLMES—his
limits.

When
I
had
got
so
far
in
my
list
I
threw
it
into
the
fire
in
despair.
“If
I
can
only
find
what
the
fellow
is
driving
at
by
reconciling
all
these
accomplishments,
and
discovering
a
calling
which
needs
them
all,”
I
said
to
myself,
“I
may
as
well
give
up
the
attempt
at
once.”

I
see
that
I
have
alluded
above
to
his
powers
upon
the
violin.
These
were
very
remarkable,
but
as
eccentric
as
all
his
other
accomplishments.
That
he
could
play
pieces,
and
difficult
pieces,
I
knew
well,
because
at
my
request
he
has
played
me
some
of
Mendelssohn’s
Lieder,
and
other
favourites.
When
left
to
himself,
however,
he
would
seldom
produce
any
music
or
attempt
any
recognized
air.
Leaning
back
in
his
arm-chair
of
an
evening,
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
scrape
carelessly
at
the
fiddle
which
was
thrown
across
his
knee.
Sometimes
the
chords
were
sonorous
and
melancholy.
Occasionally
they
were
fantastic
and
cheerful.
Clearly
they
reflected
the
thoughts
which
possessed
him,
but
whether
the
music
aided
those
thoughts,
or
whether
the
playing
was
simply
the
result
of
a
whim
or
fancy
was
more
than
I
could
determine.
I
might
have
rebelled
against
these
exasperating
solos
had
it
not
been
that
he
usually
terminated
them
by
playing
in
quick
succession
a
whole
series
of
my
favourite
airs
as
a
slight
compensation
for
the
trial
upon
my
patience.

During
the
first
week
or
so
we
had
no
callers,
and
I
had
begun
to
think
that
my
companion
was
as
friendless
a
man
as
I
was
myself.
Presently,
however,
I
found
that
he
had
many
acquaintances,
and
those
in
the
most
different
classes
of
society.
There
was
one
little
sallow
rat-faced,
dark-eyed
fellow
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
Mr.
Lestrade,
and
who
came
three
or
four
times
in
a
single
week.
One
morning
a
young
girl
called,
fashionably
dressed,
and
stayed
for
half
an
hour
or
more.
The
same
afternoon
brought
a
grey-headed,
seedy
visitor,
looking
like
a
Jew
pedlar,
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
much
excited,
and
who
was
closely
followed
by
a
slip-shod
elderly
woman.
On
another
occasion
an
old
white-haired
gentleman
had
an
interview
with
my
companion;
and
on
another
a
railway
porter
in
his
velveteen
uniform.
When
any
of
these
nondescript
individuals
put
in
an
appearance,
Sherlock
Holmes
used
to
beg
for
the
use
of
the
sitting-room,
and
I
would
retire
to
my
bed-room.
He
always
apologized
to
me
for
putting
me
to
this
inconvenience.
“I
have
to
use
this
room
as
a
place
of
business,”
he
said,
“and
these
people
are
my
clients.”
Again
I
had
an
opportunity
of
asking
him
a
point
blank
question,
and
again
my
delicacy
prevented
me
from
forcing
another
man
to
confide
in
me.
I
imagined
at
the
time
that
he
had
some
strong
reason
for
not
alluding
to
it,
but
he
soon
dispelled
the
idea
by
coming
round
to
the
subject
of
his
own
accord.

It
was
upon
the
4th
of
March,
as
I
have
good
reason
to
remember,
that
I
rose
somewhat
earlier
than
usual,
and
found
that
Sherlock
Holmes
had
not
yet
finished
his
breakfast.
The
landlady
had
become
so
accustomed
to
my
late
habits
that
my
place
had
not
been
laid
nor
my
coffee
prepared.
With
the
unreasonable
petulance
of
mankind
I
rang
the
bell
and
gave
a
curt
intimation
that
I
was
ready.
Then
I
picked
up
a
magazine
from
the
table
and
attempted
to
while
away
the
time
with
it,
while
my
companion
munched
silently
at
his
toast.
One
of
the
articles
had
a
pencil
mark
at
the
heading,
and
I
naturally
began
to
run
my
eye
through
it.

Its
somewhat
ambitious
title
was
“The
Book
of
Life,”
and
it
attempted
to
show
how
much
an
observant
man
might
learn
by
an
accurate
and
systematic
examination
of
all
that
came
in
his
way.
It
struck
me
as
being
a
remarkable
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
of
absurdity.
The
reasoning
was
close
and
intense,
but
the
deductions
appeared
to
me
to
be
far-fetched
and
exaggerated.
The
writer
claimed
by
a
momentary
expression,
a
twitch
of
a
muscle
or
a
glance
of
an
eye,
to
fathom
a
man’s
inmost
thoughts.
Deceit,
according
to
him,
was
an
impossibility
in
the
case
of
one
trained
to
observation
and
analysis.
His
conclusions
were
as
infallible
as
so
many
propositions
of
Euclid.
So
startling
would
his
results
appear
to
the
uninitiated
that
until
they
learned
the
processes
by
which
he
had
arrived
at
them
they
might
well
consider
him
as
a
necromancer.

“From
a
drop
of
water,”
said
the
writer,
“a
logician
could
infer
the
possibility
of
an
Atlantic
or
a
Niagara
without
having
seen
or
heard
of
one
or
the
other.
So
all
life
is
a
great
chain,
the
nature
of
which
is
known
whenever
we
are
shown
a
single
link
of
it.
Like
all
other
arts,
the
Science
of
Deduction
and
Analysis
is
one
which
can
only
be
acquired
by
long
and
patient
study
nor
is
life
long
enough
to
allow
any
mortal
to
attain
the
highest
possible
perfection
in
it.
Before
turning
to
those
moral
and
mental
aspects
of
the
matter
which
present
the
greatest
difficulties,
let
the
enquirer
begin
by
mastering
more
elementary
problems.
Let
him,
on
meeting
a
fellow-mortal,
learn
at
a
glance
to
distinguish
the
history
of
the
man,
and
the
trade
or
profession
to
which
he
belongs.
Puerile
as
such
an
exercise
may
seem,
it
sharpens
the
faculties
of
observation,
and
teaches
one
where
to
look
and
what
to
look
for.
By
a
man’s
finger
nails,
by
his
coat-sleeve,
by
his
boot,
by
his
trouser
knees,
by
the
callosities
of
his
forefinger
and
thumb,
by
his
expression,
by
his
shirt
cuffs—by
each
of
these
things
a
man’s
calling
is
plainly
revealed.
That
all
united
should
fail
to
enlighten
the
competent
enquirer
in
any
case
is
almost
inconceivable.”

“What
ineffable
twaddle!”
I
cried,
slapping
the
magazine
down
on
the
table,
“I
never
read
such
rubbish
in
my
life.”

“What
is
it?”
asked
Sherlock
Holmes.

“Why,
this
article,”
I
said,
pointing
at
it
with
my
egg
spoon
as
I
sat
down
to
my
breakfast.
“I
see
that
you
have
read
it
since
you
have
marked
it.
I
don’t
deny
that
it
is
smartly
written.
It
irritates
me
though.
It
is
evidently
the
theory
of
some
arm-chair
lounger
who
evolves
all
these
neat
little
paradoxes
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
study.
It
is
not
practical.
I
should
like
to
see
him
clapped
down
in
a
third
class
carriage
on
the
Underground,
and
asked
to
give
the
trades
of
all
his
fellow-travellers.
I
would
lay
a
thousand
to
one
against
him.”

“You
would
lose
your
money,”
Sherlock
Holmes
remarked
calmly.
“As
for
the
article
I
wrote
it
myself.”

“You!”

“Yes,
I
have
a
turn
both
for
observation
and
for
deduction.
The
theories
which
I
have
expressed
there,
and
which
appear
to
you
to
be
so
chimerical
are
really
extremely
practical—so
practical
that
I
depend
upon
them
for
my
bread
and
cheese.”

“And
how?”
I
asked
involuntarily.

“Well,
I
have
a
trade
of
my
own.
I
suppose
I
am
the
only
one
in
the
world.
I’m
a
consulting
detective,
if
you
can
understand
what
that
is.
Here
in
London
we
have
lots
of
Government
detectives
and
lots
of
private
ones.
When
these
fellows
are
at
fault
they
come
to
me,
and
I
manage
to
put
them
on
the
right
scent.
They
lay
all
the
evidence
before
me,
and
I
am
generally
able,
by
the
help
of
my
knowledge
of
the
history
of
crime,
to
set
them
straight.
There
is
a
strong
family
resemblance
about
misdeeds,
and
if
you
have
all
the
details
of
a
thousand
at
your
finger
ends,
it
is
odd
if
you
can’t
unravel
the
thousand
and
first.
Lestrade
is
a
well-known
detective.
He
got
himself
into
a
fog
recently
over
a
forgery
case,
and
that
was
what
brought
him
here.”

“And
these
other
people?”

“They
are
mostly
sent
on
by
private
inquiry
agencies.
They
are
all
people
who
are
in
trouble
about
something,
and
want
a
little
enlightening.
I
listen
to
their
story,
they
listen
to
my
comments,
and
then
I
pocket
my
fee.”

“But
do
you
mean
to
say,”
I
said,
“that
without
leaving
your
room
you
can
unravel
some
knot
which
other
men
can
make
nothing
of,
although
they
have
seen
every
detail
for
themselves?”

“Quite
so.
I
have
a
kind
of
intuition
that
way.
Now
and
again
a
case
turns
up
which
is
a
little
more
complex.
Then
I
have
to
bustle
about
and
see
things
with
my
own
eyes.
You
see
I
have
a
lot
of
special
knowledge
which
I
apply
to
the
problem,
and
which
facilitates
matters
wonderfully.
Those
rules
of
deduction
laid
down
in
that
article
which
aroused
your
scorn,
are
invaluable
to
me
in
practical
work.
Observation
with
me
is
second
nature.
You
appeared
to
be
surprised
when
I
told
you,
on
our
first
meeting,
that
you
had
come
from
Afghanistan.”

“You
were
told,
no
doubt.”

“Nothing
of
the
sort.
I
knew
you
came
from
Afghanistan.
From
long
habit
the
train
of
thoughts
ran
so
swiftly
through
my
mind,
that
I
arrived
at
the
conclusion
without
being
conscious
of
intermediate
steps.
There
were
such
steps,
however.
The
train
of
reasoning
ran,
‘Here
is
a
gentleman
of
a
medical
type,
but
with
the
air
of
a
military
man.
Clearly
an
army
doctor,
then.
He
has
just
come
from
the
tropics,
for
his
face
is
dark,
and
that
is
not
the
natural
tint
of
his
skin,
for
his
wrists
are
fair.
He
has
undergone
hardship
and
sickness,
as
his
haggard
face
says
clearly.
His
left
arm
has
been
injured.
He
holds
it
in
a
stiff
and
unnatural
manner.
Where
in
the
tropics
could
an
English
army
doctor
have
seen
much
hardship
and
got
his
arm
wounded?
Clearly
in
Afghanistan.’
The
whole
train
of
thought
did
not
occupy
a
second.
I
then
remarked
that
you
came
from
Afghanistan,
and
you
were
astonished.”

“It
is
simple
enough
as
you
explain
it,”
I
said,
smiling.
“You
remind
me
of
Edgar
Allen
Poe’s
Dupin.
I
had
no
idea
that
such
individuals
did
exist
outside
of
stories.”

Sherlock
Holmes
rose
and
lit
his
pipe.
“No
doubt
you
think
that
you
are
complimenting
me
in
comparing
me
to
Dupin,”
he
observed.
“Now,
in
my
opinion,
Dupin
was
a
very
inferior
fellow.
That
trick
of
his
of
breaking
in
on
his
friends’
thoughts
with
an
apropos
remark
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour’s
silence
is
really
very
showy
and
superficial.
He
had
some
analytical
genius,
no
doubt;
but
he
was
by
no
means
such
a
phenomenon
as
Poe
appeared
to
imagine.”

“Have
you
read
Gaboriau’s
works?”
I
asked.
“Does
Lecoq
come
up
to
your
idea
of
a
detective?”

Sherlock
Holmes
sniffed
sardonically.
“Lecoq
was
a
miserable
bungler,”
he
said,
in
an
angry
voice;
“he
had
only
one
thing
to
recommend
him,
and
that
was
his
energy.
That
book
made
me
positively
ill.
The
question
was
how
to
identify
an
unknown
prisoner.
I
could
have
done
it
in
twenty-four
hours.
Lecoq
took
six
months
or
so.
It
might
be
made
a
text-book
for
detectives
to
teach
them
what
to
avoid.”

I
felt
rather
indignant
at
having
two
characters
whom
I
had
admired
treated
in
this
cavalier
style.
I
walked
over
to
the
window,
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
busy
street.
“This
fellow
may
be
very
clever,”
I
said
to
myself,
“but
he
is
certainly
very
conceited.”

“There
are
no
crimes
and
no
criminals
in
these
days,”
he
said,
querulously.
“What
is
the
use
of
having
brains
in
our
profession.
I
know
well
that
I
have
it
in
me
to
make
my
name
famous.
No
man
lives
or
has
ever
lived
who
has
brought
the
same
amount
of
study
and
of
natural
talent
to
the
detection
of
crime
which
I
have
done.
And
what
is
the
result?
There
is
no
crime
to
detect,
or,
at
most,
some
bungling
villainy
with
a
motive
so
transparent
that
even
a
Scotland
Yard
official
can
see
through
it.”

I
was
still
annoyed
at
his
bumptious
style
of
conversation.
I
thought
it
best
to
change
the
topic.

“I
wonder
what
that
fellow
is
looking
for?”
I
asked,
pointing
to
a
stalwart,
plainly-dressed
individual
who
was
walking
slowly
down
the
other
side
of
the
street,
looking
anxiously
at
the
numbers.
He
had
a
large
blue
envelope
in
his
hand,
and
was
evidently
the
bearer
of
a
message.

“You
mean
the
retired
sergeant
of
Marines,”
said
Sherlock
Holmes.

“Brag
and
bounce!”
thought
I
to
myself.
“He
knows
that
I
cannot
verify
his
guess.”

The
thought
had
hardly
passed
through
my
mind
when
the
man
whom
we
were
watching
caught
sight
of
the
number
on
our
door,
and
ran
rapidly
across
the
roadway.
We
heard
a
loud
knock,
a
deep
voice
below,
and
heavy
steps
ascending
the
stair.

“For
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,”
he
said,
stepping
into
the
room
and
handing
my
friend
the
letter.

Here
was
an
opportunity
of
taking
the
conceit
out
of
him.
He
little
thought
of
this
when
he
made
that
random
shot.
“May
I
ask,
my
lad,”
I
said,
in
the
blandest
voice,
“what
your
trade
may
be?”

“Commissionaire,
sir,”
he
said,
gruffly.
“Uniform
away
for
repairs.”

“And
you
were?”
I
asked,
with
a
slightly
malicious
glance
at
my
companion.

“A
sergeant,
sir,
Royal
Marine
Light
Infantry,
sir.
No
answer?
Right,
sir.”

He
clicked
his
heels
together,
raised
his
hand
in
a
salute,
and
was
gone.





CHAPTER
III.
THE
LAURISTON
GARDEN
MYSTERY
6

I
CONFESS
that
I
was
considerably
startled
by
this
fresh
proof
of
the
practical
nature
of
my
companion’s
theories.
My
respect
for
his
powers
of
analysis
increased
wondrously.
There
still
remained
some
lurking
suspicion
in
my
mind,
however,
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
pre-arranged
episode,
intended
to
dazzle
me,
though
what
earthly
object
he
could
have
in
taking
me
in
was
past
my
comprehension.
When
I
looked
at
him
he
had
finished
reading
the
note,
and
his
eyes
had
assumed
the
vacant,
lack-lustre
expression
which
showed
mental
abstraction.

“How
in
the
world
did
you
deduce
that?”
I
asked.

“Deduce
what?”
said
he,
petulantly.

“Why,
that
he
was
a
retired
sergeant
of
Marines.”

“I
have
no
time
for
trifles,”
he
answered,
brusquely;
then
with
a
smile,
“Excuse
my
rudeness.
You
broke
the
thread
of
my
thoughts;
but
perhaps
it
is
as
well.
So
you
actually
were
not
able
to
see
that
that
man
was
a
sergeant
of
Marines?”

“No,
indeed.”

“It
was
easier
to
know
it
than
to
explain
why
I
knew
it.
If
you
were
asked
to
prove
that
two
and
two
made
four,
you
might
find
some
difficulty,
and
yet
you
are
quite
sure
of
the
fact.
Even
across
the
street
I
could
see
a
great
blue
anchor
tattooed
on
the
back
of
the
fellow’s
hand.
That
smacked
of
the
sea.
He
had
a
military
carriage,
however,
and
regulation
side
whiskers.
There
we
have
the
marine.
He
was
a
man
with
some
amount
of
self-importance
and
a
certain
air
of
command.
You
must
have
observed
the
way
in
which
he
held
his
head
and
swung
his
cane.
A
steady,
respectable,
middle-aged
man,
too,
on
the
face
of
him—all
facts
which
led
me
to
believe
that
he
had
been
a
sergeant.”

“Wonderful!”
I
ejaculated.

“Commonplace,”
said
Holmes,
though
I
thought
from
his
expression
that
he
was
pleased
at
my
evident
surprise
and
admiration.
“I
said
just
now
that
there
were
no
criminals.
It
appears
that
I
am
wrong—look
at
this!”
He
threw
me
over
the
note
which
the
commissionaire
had
brought.
7

“Why,”
I
cried,
as
I
cast
my
eye
over
it,
“this
is
terrible!”

“It
does
seem
to
be
a
little
out
of
the
common,”
he
remarked,
calmly.
“Would
you
mind
reading
it
to
me
aloud?”

This
is
the
letter
which
I
read
to
him——

“MY
DEAR
MR.
SHERLOCK
HOLMES,—

“There
has
been
a
bad
business
during
the
night
at
3,
Lauriston
Gardens,
off
the
Brixton
Road.
Our
man
on
the
beat
saw
a
light
there
about
two
in
the
morning,
and
as
the
house
was
an
empty
one,
suspected
that
something
was
amiss.
He
found
the
door
open,
and
in
the
front
room,
which
is
bare
of
furniture,
discovered
the
body
of
a
gentleman,
well
dressed,
and
having
cards
in
his
pocket
bearing
the
name
of
‘Enoch
J.
Drebber,
Cleveland,
Ohio,
U.S.A.’
There
had
been
no
robbery,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
as
to
how
the
man
met
his
death.
There
are
marks
of
blood
in
the
room,
but
there
is
no
wound
upon
his
person.
We
are
at
a
loss
as
to
how
he
came
into
the
empty
house;
indeed,
the
whole
affair
is
a
puzzler.
If
you
can
come
round
to
the
house
any
time
before
twelve,
you
will
find
me
there.
I
have
left
everything
in
statu
quo
until
I
hear
from
you.
If
you
are
unable
to
come
I
shall
give
you
fuller
details,
and
would
esteem
it
a
great
kindness
if
you
would
favour
me
with
your
opinion.
Yours
faithfully,

“TOBIAS
GREGSON.”

“Gregson
is
the
smartest
of
the
Scotland
Yarders,”
my
friend
remarked;
“he
and
Lestrade
are
the
pick
of
a
bad
lot.
They
are
both
quick
and
energetic,
but
conventional—shockingly
so.
They
have
their
knives
into
one
another,
too.
They
are
as
jealous
as
a
pair
of
professional
beauties.
There
will
be
some
fun
over
this
case
if
they
are
both
put
upon
the
scent.”

I
was
amazed
at
the
calm
way
in
which
he
rippled
on.
“Surely
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost,”
I
cried,
“shall
I
go
and
order
you
a
cab?”

“I’m
not
sure
about
whether
I
shall
go.
I
am
the
most
incurably
lazy
devil
that
ever
stood
in
shoe
leather—that
is,
when
the
fit
is
on
me,
for
I
can
be
spry
enough
at
times.”

“Why,
it
is
just
such
a
chance
as
you
have
been
longing
for.”

“My
dear
fellow,
what
does
it
matter
to
me.
Supposing
I
unravel
the
whole
matter,
you
may
be
sure
that
Gregson,
Lestrade,
and
Co.
will
pocket
all
the
credit.
That
comes
of
being
an
unofficial
personage.”

“But
he
begs
you
to
help
him.”

“Yes.
He
knows
that
I
am
his
superior,
and
acknowledges
it
to
me;
but
he
would
cut
his
tongue
out
before
he
would
own
it
to
any
third
person.
However,
we
may
as
well
go
and
have
a
look.
I
shall
work
it
out
on
my
own
hook.
I
may
have
a
laugh
at
them
if
I
have
nothing
else.
Come
on!”

He
hustled
on
his
overcoat,
and
bustled
about
in
a
way
that
showed
that
an
energetic
fit
had
superseded
the
apathetic
one.

“Get
your
hat,”
he
said.

“You
wish
me
to
come?”

“Yes,
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do.”
A
minute
later
we
were
both
in
a
hansom,
driving
furiously
for
the
Brixton
Road.

It
was
a
foggy,
cloudy
morning,
and
a
dun-coloured
veil
hung
over
the
house-tops,
looking
like
the
reflection
of
the
mud-coloured
streets
beneath.
My
companion
was
in
the
best
of
spirits,
and
prattled
away
about
Cremona
fiddles,
and
the
difference
between
a
Stradivarius
and
an
Amati.
As
for
myself,
I
was
silent,
for
the
dull
weather
and
the
melancholy
business
upon
which
we
were
engaged,
depressed
my
spirits.

“You
don’t
seem
to
give
much
thought
to
the
matter
in
hand,”
I
said
at
last,
interrupting
Holmes’
musical
disquisition.

“No
data
yet,”
he
answered.
“It
is
a
capital
mistake
to
theorize
before
you
have
all
the
evidence.
It
biases
the
judgment.”

“You
will
have
your
data
soon,”
I
remarked,
pointing
with
my
finger;
“this
is
the
Brixton
Road,
and
that
is
the
house,
if
I
am
not
very
much
mistaken.”

“So
it
is.
Stop,
driver,
stop!”
We
were
still
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
it,
but
he
insisted
upon
our
alighting,
and
we
finished
our
journey
upon
foot.

Number
3,
Lauriston
Gardens
wore
an
ill-omened
and
minatory
look.
It
was
one
of
four
which
stood
back
some
little
way
from
the
street,
two
being
occupied
and
two
empty.
The
latter
looked
out
with
three
tiers
of
vacant
melancholy
windows,
which
were
blank
and
dreary,
save
that
here
and
there
a
“To
Let”
card
had
developed
like
a
cataract
upon
the
bleared
panes.
A
small
garden
sprinkled
over
with
a
scattered
eruption
of
sickly
plants
separated
each
of
these
houses
from
the
street,
and
was
traversed
by
a
narrow
pathway,
yellowish
in
colour,
and
consisting
apparently
of
a
mixture
of
clay
and
of
gravel.
The
whole
place
was
very
sloppy
from
the
rain
which
had
fallen
through
the
night.
The
garden
was
bounded
by
a
three-foot
brick
wall
with
a
fringe
of
wood
rails
upon
the
top,
and
against
this
wall
was
leaning
a
stalwart
police
constable,
surrounded
by
a
small
knot
of
loafers,
who
craned
their
necks
and
strained
their
eyes
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
some
glimpse
of
the
proceedings
within.

I
had
imagined
that
Sherlock
Holmes
would
at
once
have
hurried
into
the
house
and
plunged
into
a
study
of
the
mystery.
Nothing
appeared
to
be
further
from
his
intention.
With
an
air
of
nonchalance
which,
under
the
circumstances,
seemed
to
me
to
border
upon
affectation,
he
lounged
up
and
down
the
pavement,
and
gazed
vacantly
at
the
ground,
the
sky,
the
opposite
houses
and
the
line
of
railings.
Having
finished
his
scrutiny,
he
proceeded
slowly
down
the
path,
or
rather
down
the
fringe
of
grass
which
flanked
the
path,
keeping
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
ground.
Twice
he
stopped,
and
once
I
saw
him
smile,
and
heard
him
utter
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction.
There
were
many
marks
of
footsteps
upon
the
wet
clayey
soil,
but
since
the
police
had
been
coming
and
going
over
it,
I
was
unable
to
see
how
my
companion
could
hope
to
learn
anything
from
it.
Still
I
had
had
such
extraordinary
evidence
of
the
quickness
of
his
perceptive
faculties,
that
I
had
no
doubt
that
he
could
see
a
great
deal
which
was
hidden
from
me.

At
the
door
of
the
house
we
were
met
by
a
tall,
white-faced,
flaxen-haired
man,
with
a
notebook
in
his
hand,
who
rushed
forward
and
wrung
my
companion’s
hand
with
effusion.
“It
is
indeed
kind
of
you
to
come,”
he
said,
“I
have
had
everything
left
untouched.”

“Except
that!”
my
friend
answered,
pointing
at
the
pathway.
“If
a
herd
of
buffaloes
had
passed
along
there
could
not
be
a
greater
mess.
No
doubt,
however,
you
had
drawn
your
own
conclusions,
Gregson,
before
you
permitted
this.”

“I
have
had
so
much
to
do
inside
the
house,”
the
detective
said
evasively.
“My
colleague,
Mr.
Lestrade,
is
here.
I
had
relied
upon
him
to
look
after
this.”

Holmes
glanced
at
me
and
raised
his
eyebrows
sardonically.
“With
two
such
men
as
yourself
and
Lestrade
upon
the
ground,
there
will
not
be
much
for
a
third
party
to
find
out,”
he
said.

Gregson
rubbed
his
hands
in
a
self-satisfied
way.
“I
think
we
have
done
all
that
can
be
done,”
he
answered;
“it’s
a
queer
case
though,
and
I
knew
your
taste
for
such
things.”

“You
did
not
come
here
in
a
cab?”
asked
Sherlock
Holmes.

“No,
sir.”

“Nor
Lestrade?”

“No,
sir.”

“Then
let
us
go
and
look
at
the
room.”
With
which
inconsequent
remark
he
strode
on
into
the
house,
followed
by
Gregson,
whose
features
expressed
his
astonishment.

A
short
passage,
bare
planked
and
dusty,
led
to
the
kitchen
and
offices.
Two
doors
opened
out
of
it
to
the
left
and
to
the
right.
One
of
these
had
obviously
been
closed
for
many
weeks.
The
other
belonged
to
the
dining-room,
which
was
the
apartment
in
which
the
mysterious
affair
had
occurred.
Holmes
walked
in,
and
I
followed
him
with
that
subdued
feeling
at
my
heart
which
the
presence
of
death
inspires.

It
was
a
large
square
room,
looking
all
the
larger
from
the
absence
of
all
furniture.
A
vulgar
flaring
paper
adorned
the
walls,
but
it
was
blotched
in
places
with
mildew,
and
here
and
there
great
strips
had
become
detached
and
hung
down,
exposing
the
yellow
plaster
beneath.
Opposite
the
door
was
a
showy
fireplace,
surmounted
by
a
mantelpiece
of
imitation
white
marble.
On
one
corner
of
this
was
stuck
the
stump
of
a
red
wax
candle.
The
solitary
window
was
so
dirty
that
the
light
was
hazy
and
uncertain,
giving
a
dull
grey
tinge
to
everything,
which
was
intensified
by
the
thick
layer
of
dust
which
coated
the
whole
apartment.

All
these
details
I
observed
afterwards.
At
present
my
attention
was
centred
upon
the
single
grim
motionless
figure
which
lay
stretched
upon
the
boards,
with
vacant
sightless
eyes
staring
up
at
the
discoloured
ceiling.
It
was
that
of
a
man
about
forty-three
or
forty-four
years
of
age,
middle-sized,
broad
shouldered,
with
crisp
curling
black
hair,
and
a
short
stubbly
beard.
He
was
dressed
in
a
heavy
broadcloth
frock
coat
and
waistcoat,
with
light-coloured
trousers,
and
immaculate
collar
and
cuffs.
A
top
hat,
well
brushed
and
trim,
was
placed
upon
the
floor
beside
him.
His
hands
were
clenched
and
his
arms
thrown
abroad,
while
his
lower
limbs
were
interlocked
as
though
his
death
struggle
had
been
a
grievous
one.
On
his
rigid
face
there
stood
an
expression
of
horror,
and
as
it
seemed
to
me,
of
hatred,
such
as
I
have
never
seen
upon
human
features.
This
malignant
and
terrible
contortion,
combined
with
the
low
forehead,
blunt
nose,
and
prognathous
jaw
gave
the
dead
man
a
singularly
simious
and
ape-like
appearance,
which
was
increased
by
his
writhing,
unnatural
posture.
I
have
seen
death
in
many
forms,
but
never
has
it
appeared
to
me
in
a
more
fearsome
aspect
than
in
that
dark
grimy
apartment,
which
looked
out
upon
one
of
the
main
arteries
of
suburban
London.

Lestrade,
lean
and
ferret-like
as
ever,
was
standing
by
the
doorway,
and
greeted
my
companion
and
myself.

“This
case
will
make
a
stir,
sir,”
he
remarked.
“It
beats
anything
I
have
seen,
and
I
am
no
chicken.”

“There
is
no
clue?”
said
Gregson.

“None
at
all,”
chimed
in
Lestrade.

Sherlock
Holmes
approached
the
body,
and,
kneeling
down,
examined
it
intently.
“You
are
sure
that
there
is
no
wound?”
he
asked,
pointing
to
numerous
gouts
and
splashes
of
blood
which
lay
all
round.

“Positive!”
cried
both
detectives.

“Then,
of
course,
this
blood
belongs
to
a
second
individual—8
presumably
the
murderer,
if
murder
has
been
committed.
It
reminds
me
of
the
circumstances
attendant
on
the
death
of
Van
Jansen,
in
Utrecht,
in
the
year
‘34.
Do
you
remember
the
case,
Gregson?”

“No,
sir.”

“Read
it
up—you
really
should.
There
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun.
It
has
all
been
done
before.”

As
he
spoke,
his
nimble
fingers
were
flying
here,
there,
and
everywhere,
feeling,
pressing,
unbuttoning,
examining,
while
his
eyes
wore
the
same
far-away
expression
which
I
have
already
remarked
upon.
So
swiftly
was
the
examination
made,
that
one
would
hardly
have
guessed
the
minuteness
with
which
it
was
conducted.
Finally,
he
sniffed
the
dead
man’s
lips,
and
then
glanced
at
the
soles
of
his
patent
leather
boots.

“He
has
not
been
moved
at
all?”
he
asked.

“No
more
than
was
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
our
examination.”

“You
can
take
him
to
the
mortuary
now,”
he
said.
“There
is
nothing
more
to
be
learned.”

Gregson
had
a
stretcher
and
four
men
at
hand.
At
his
call
they
entered
the
room,
and
the
stranger
was
lifted
and
carried
out.
As
they
raised
him,
a
ring
tinkled
down
and
rolled
across
the
floor.
Lestrade
grabbed
it
up
and
stared
at
it
with
mystified
eyes.

“There’s
been
a
woman
here,”
he
cried.
“It’s
a
woman’s
wedding-ring.”

He
held
it
out,
as
he
spoke,
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand.
We
all
gathered
round
him
and
gazed
at
it.
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
that
circlet
of
plain
gold
had
once
adorned
the
finger
of
a
bride.

“This
complicates
matters,”
said
Gregson.
“Heaven
knows,
they
were
complicated
enough
before.”

“You’re
sure
it
doesn’t
simplify
them?”
observed
Holmes.
“There’s
nothing
to
be
learned
by
staring
at
it.
What
did
you
find
in
his
pockets?”

“We
have
it
all
here,”
said
Gregson,
pointing
to
a
litter
of
objects
upon
one
of
the
bottom
steps
of
the
stairs.
“A
gold
watch,

No

but

of

Pocket

upon
the

Two
letters—one
addressed

E.
J.
Drebber
and
one
to
Joseph
Stangerson.”

“At
what
address?”

“American
Exchange,
Strand—to
be
left
till
called
for.
They
are
both
from
the
Guion
Steamship
Company,
and
refer
to
the
sailing
of
their
boats
from
Liverpool.
It
is
clear
that
this
unfortunate
man
was
about
to
return
to
New
York.”

“Have
you
made
any
inquiries
as
to
this
man,
Stangerson?”

“I
did
it
at
once,
sir,”
said
Gregson.
“I
have
had
advertisements
sent
to
all
the
newspapers,
and
one
of
my
men
has
gone
to
the
American
Exchange,
but
he
has
not
returned
yet.”

“Have
you
sent
to
Cleveland?”

“We
telegraphed
this
morning.”

“How
did
you
word
your
inquiries?”

“We
simply
detailed
the
circumstances,
and
said
that
we
should
be
glad
of
any
information
which
could
help
us.”

“You
did
not
ask
for
particulars
on
any
point
which
appeared
to
you
to
be
crucial?”

“I
asked
about
Stangerson.”

“Nothing
else?
Is
there
no
circumstance
on
which
this
whole
case
appears
to
hinge?
Will
you
not
telegraph
again?”

“I
have
said
all
I
have
to
say,”
said
Gregson,
in
an
offended
voice.

Sherlock
Holmes
chuckled
to
himself,
and
appeared
to
be
about
to
make
some
remark,
when
Lestrade,
who
had
been
in
the
front
room
while
we
were
holding
this
conversation
in
the
hall,
reappeared
upon
the
scene,
rubbing
his
hands
in
a
pompous
and
self-satisfied
manner.

“Mr.
Gregson,”
he
said,
“I
have
just
made
a
discovery
of
the
highest
importance,
and
one
which
would
have
been
overlooked
had
I
not
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
walls.”

The
little
man’s
eyes
sparkled
as
he
spoke,
and
he
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
suppressed
exultation
at
having
scored
a
point
against
his
colleague.

“Come
here,”
he
said,
bustling
back
into
the
room,
the
atmosphere
of
which
felt
clearer
since
the
removal
of
its
ghastly
inmate.
“Now,
stand
there!”

He
struck
a
match
on
his
boot
and
held
it
up
against
the
wall.

“Look
at
that!”
he
said,
triumphantly.

I
have
remarked
that
the
paper
had
fallen
away
in
parts.
In
this
particular
corner
of
the
room
a
large
piece
had
peeled
off,
leaving
a
yellow
square
of
coarse
plastering.
Across
this
bare
space
there
was
scrawled
in
blood-red
letters
a
single
word—


























RACHE.

“What
do
you
think
of
that?”
cried
the
detective,
with
the
air
of
a
showman
exhibiting
his
show.
“This
was
overlooked
because
it
was
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room,
and
no
one
thought
of
looking
there.
The
murderer
has
written
it
with
his
or
her
own
blood.
See
this
smear
where
it
has
trickled
down
the
wall!
That
disposes
of
the
idea
of
suicide
anyhow.
Why
was
that
corner
chosen
to
write
it
on?
I
will
tell
you.
See
that
candle
on
the
mantelpiece.
It
was
lit
at
the
time,
and
if
it
was
lit
this
corner
would
be
the
brightest
instead
of
the
darkest
portion
of
the
wall.”

“And
what
does
it
mean
now
that
you
have
found
it?”
asked
Gregson
in
a
depreciatory
voice.

“Mean?
Why,
it
means
that
the
writer
was
going
to
put
the
female
name
Rachel,
but
was
disturbed
before
he
or
she
had
time
to
finish.
You
mark
my
words,
when
this
case
comes
to
be
cleared
up
you
will
find
that
a
woman
named
Rachel
has
something
to
do
with
it.
It’s
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes.
You
may
be
very
smart
and
clever,
but
the
old
hound
is
the
best,
when
all
is
said
and
done.”

“I
really
beg
your
pardon!”
said
my
companion,
who
had
ruffled
the
little
man’s
temper
by
bursting
into
an
explosion
of
laughter.
“You
certainly
have
the
credit
of
being
the
first
of
us
to
find
this
out,
and,
as
you
say,
it
bears
every
mark
of
having
been
written
by
the
other
participant
in
last
night’s
mystery.
I
have
not
had
time
to
examine
this
room
yet,
but
with
your
permission
I
shall
do
so
now.”

As
he
spoke,
he
whipped
a
tape
measure
and
a
large
round
magnifying
glass
from
his
pocket.
With
these
two
implements
he
trotted
noiselessly
about
the
room,
sometimes
stopping,
occasionally
kneeling,
and
once
lying
flat
upon
his
face.
So
engrossed
was
he
with
his
occupation
that
he
appeared
to
have
forgotten
our
presence,
for
he
chattered
away
to
himself
under
his
breath
the
whole
time,
keeping
up
a
running
fire
of
exclamations,
groans,
whistles,
and
little
cries
suggestive
of
encouragement
and
of
hope.
As
I
watched
him
I
was
irresistibly
reminded
of
a
pure-blooded
well-trained
foxhound
as
it
dashes
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
covert,
whining
in
its
eagerness,
until
it
comes
across
the
lost
scent.
For
twenty
minutes
or
more
he
continued
his
researches,
measuring
with
the
most
exact
care
the
distance
between
marks
which
were
entirely
invisible
to
me,
and
occasionally
applying
his
tape
to
the
walls
in
an
equally
incomprehensible
manner.
In
one
place
he
gathered
up
very
carefully
a
little
pile
of
grey
dust
from
the
floor,
and
packed
it
away
in
an
envelope.
Finally,
he
examined
with
his
glass
the
word
upon
the
wall,
going
over
every
letter
of
it
with
the
most
minute
exactness.
This
done,
he
appeared
to
be
satisfied,
for
he
replaced
his
tape
and
his
glass
in
his
pocket.

“They
say
that
genius
is
an
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains,”
he
remarked
with
a
smile.
“It’s
a
very
bad
definition,
but
it
does
apply
to
detective
work.”

Gregson
and
Lestrade
had
watched

of
their
amateur
companion
with
considerable
curiosity
and
some
contempt.
They
evidently
failed
to
appreciate
the
fact,
which
I
had
begun
to
realize,
that
Sherlock
Holmes’
smallest
actions
were
all
directed
towards
some
definite
and
practical
end.

“What
do
you
think
of
it,
sir?”
they
both
asked.

“It
would
be
robbing
you
of
the
credit
of
the
case
if
I
was
to
presume
to
help
you,”
remarked
my
friend.
“You
are
doing
so
well
now
that
it
would
be
a
pity
for
anyone
to
interfere.”
There
was
a
world
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke.
“If
you
will
let
me
know
how
your
investigations
go,”
he
continued,
“I
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
any
help
I
can.
In
the
meantime
I
should
like
to
speak
to
the
constable
who
found
the
body.
Can
you
give
me
his
name
and
address?”

Lestrade
glanced
at
his
note-book.
“John
Rance,”
he
said.
“He
is
off
duty
now.
You
will
find
him
at
46,
Audley
Court,
Kennington
Park
Gate.”

Holmes
took
a
note
of
the
address.

“Come
along,
Doctor,”
he
said;
“we
shall
go
and
look
him
up.
I’ll
tell
you
one
thing
which
may
help
you
in
the
case,”
he
continued,
turning
to
the
two
detectives.
“There
has
been
murder
done,
and
the
murderer
was
a
man.
He
was
more
than
six
feet
high,
was
in
the
prime
of
life,
had
small
feet
for
his
height,
wore
coarse,
square-toed
boots
and
smoked
a
Trichinopoly
cigar.
He
came
here
with
his
victim
in
a
four-wheeled
cab,
which
was
drawn
by
a
horse
with
three
old
shoes
and
one
new
one
on
his
off
fore
leg.
In
all
probability
the
murderer
had
a
florid
face,
and
the
finger-nails
of
his
right
hand
were
remarkably
long.
These
are
only
a
few
indications,
but
they
may
assist
you.”

Lestrade
and
Gregson
glanced
at
each
other
with
an
incredulous
smile.

“If
this
man
was
murdered,
how
was
it
done?”
asked
the
former.

“Poison,”
said
Sherlock
Holmes
curtly,
and
strode
off.
“One
other
thing,
Lestrade,”
he
added,
turning
round
at
the
door:
“‘Rache,’
is
the
German
for
‘revenge;’
so
don’t
lose
your
time
looking
for
Miss
Rachel.”

With
which
Parthian
shot
he
walked
away,
leaving
the
two
rivals
open-mouthed
behind
him.





CHAPTER
IV.
WHAT
JOHN
RANCE
HAD
TO
TELL.

IT
was
one
o’clock
when
we
left
No.
3,
Lauriston
Gardens.
Sherlock
Holmes
led
me
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office,
whence
he
dispatched
a
long
telegram.
He
then
hailed
a
cab,
and
ordered
the
driver
to
take
us
to
the
address
given
us
by
Lestrade.

“There
is
nothing
like
first
hand
evidence,”
he
remarked;
“as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
mind
is
entirely
made
up
upon
the
case,
but
still
we
may
as
well
learn
all
that
is
to
be
learned.”

“You
amaze
me,
Holmes,”
said
I.
“Surely
you
are
not
as
sure
as
you
pretend
to
be
of
all
those
particulars
which
you
gave.”

“There’s
no
room
for
a
mistake,”
he
answered.
“The
very
first
thing
which
I
observed
on
arriving
there
was
that
a
cab
had
made
two
ruts
with
its
wheels
close
to
the
curb.
Now,
up
to
last
night,
we
have
had
no
rain
for
a
week,
so
that
those
wheels
which
left
such
a
deep
impression
must
have
been
there
during
the
night.
There
were
the
marks
of
the
horse’s
hoofs,
too,
the
outline
of
one
of
which
was
far
more
clearly
cut
than
that
of
the
other
three,
showing
that
that
was
a
new
shoe.
Since
the
cab
was
there
after
the
rain
began,
and
was
not
there
at
any
time
during
the
morning—I
have
Gregson’s
word
for
that—it
follows
that
it
must
have
been
there
during
the
night,
and,
therefore,
that
it
brought
those
two
individuals
to
the
house.”

“That
seems
simple
enough,”
said
I;
“but
how
about
the
other
man’s
height?”

“Why,
the
height
of
a
man,
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten,
can
be
told
from
the
length
of
his
stride.
It
is
a
simple
calculation
enough,
though
there
is
no
use
my
boring
you
with
figures.
I
had
this
fellow’s
stride
both
on
the
clay
outside
and
on
the
dust
within.
Then
I
had
a
way
of
checking
my
calculation.
When
a
man
writes
on
a
wall,
his
instinct
leads
him
to
write
about
the
level
of
his
own
eyes.
Now
that
writing
was
just
over
six
feet
from
the
ground.
It
was
child’s
play.”

“And
his
age?”
I
asked.

“Well,
if
a
man
can
stride
four
and
a-half
feet
without
the
smallest
effort,
he
can’t
be
quite
in
the
sere
and
yellow.
That
was
the
breadth
of
a
puddle
on
the
garden
walk
which
he
had
evidently
walked
across.
Patent-leather
boots
had
gone
round,
and
Square-toes
had
hopped
over.
There
is
no
mystery
about
it
at
all.
I
am
simply
applying
to
ordinary
life
a
few
of
those
precepts
of
observation
and
deduction
which
I
advocated
in
that
article.
Is
there
anything
else
that
puzzles
you?”

“The
finger
nails
and
the
Trichinopoly,”
I
suggested.

“The
writing
on
the
wall
was
done
with
a
man’s
forefinger
dipped
in
blood.
My
glass
allowed
me
to
observe
that
the
plaster
was
slightly
scratched
in
doing
it,
which
would
not
have
been
the
case
if
the
man’s
nail
had
been
trimmed.
I
gathered
up
some
scattered
ash
from
the
floor.
It
was
dark
in
colour
and
flakey—such
an
ash
as
is
only
made
by
a
Trichinopoly.
I
have
made
a
special
study
of
cigar
ashes—in
fact,
I
have
written
a
monograph
upon
the
subject.
I
flatter
myself
that
I
can
distinguish
at
a
glance
the
ash
of
any
known
brand,
either
of
cigar
or
of
tobacco.
It
is
just
in
such
details
that
the
skilled
detective
differs
from
the
Gregson
and
Lestrade
type.”

“And
the
florid
face?”
I
asked.

“Ah,
that
was
a
more
daring
shot,
though
I
have
no
doubt
that
I
was
right.
You
must
not
ask
me
that
at
the
present
state
of
the
affair.”

I
passed
my
hand
over
my
brow.
“My
head
is
in
a
whirl,”
I
remarked;
“the
more
one
thinks
of
it
the
more
mysterious
it
grows.
How
came
these
two
men—if
there
were
two
men—into
an
empty
house?
What
has
become
of
the
cabman
who
drove
them?
How
could
one
man
compel
another
to
take
poison?
Where
did
the
blood
come
from?
What
was
the
object
of
the
murderer,
since
robbery
had
no
part
in
it?
How
came
the
woman’s
ring
there?
Above
all,
why
should
the
second
man
write
up
the
German
word
RACHE
before
decamping?
I
confess
that
I
cannot
see
any
possible
way
of
reconciling
all
these
facts.”

My
companion
smiled
approvingly.

“You
sum
up
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
succinctly
and
well,”
he
said.
“There
is
much
that
is
still
obscure,
though
I
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
on
the
main
facts.
As
to
poor
Lestrade’s
discovery
it
was
simply
a
blind
intended
to
put
the
police
upon
a
wrong
track,
by
suggesting
Socialism
and
secret
societies.
It
was
not
done
by
a
German.
The
A,
if
you
noticed,
was
printed
somewhat
after
the
German
fashion.
Now,
a
real
German
invariably
prints
in
the
Latin
character,
so
that
we
may
safely
say
that
this
was
not
written
by
one,
but
by
a
clumsy
imitator
who
overdid
his
part.
It
was
simply
a
ruse
to
divert
inquiry
into
a
wrong
channel.
I’m
not
going
to
tell
you
much
more
of
the
case,
Doctor.
You
know
a
conjuror
gets
no
credit
when
once
he
has
explained
his
trick,
and
if
I
show
you
too
much
of
my
method
of
working,
you
will
come
to
the
conclusion
that
I
am
a
very
ordinary
individual
after
all.”

“I
shall
never
do
that,”
I
answered;
“you
have
brought
detection
as
near
an
exact
science
as
it
ever
will
be
brought
in
this
world.”

My
companion
flushed
up
with
pleasure
at
my
words,
and
the
earnest
way
in
which
I
uttered
them.
I
had
already
observed
that
he
was
as
sensitive
to
flattery
on
the
score
of
his
art
as
any
girl
could
be
of
her
beauty.

“I’ll
tell
you
one
other
thing,”
he
said.
“Patent
leathers
10
and
Square-toes
came
in
the
same
cab,
and
they
walked
down
the
pathway
together
as
friendly
as
possible—arm-in-arm,
in
all
probability.
When
they
got
inside
they
walked
up
and
down
the
room—or
rather,
Patent-leathers
stood
still
while
Square-toes
walked
up
and
down.
I
could
read
all
that
in
the
dust;
and
I
could
read
that
as
he
walked
he
grew
more
and
more
excited.
That
is
shown
by
the
increased
length
of
his
strides.
He
was
talking
all
the
while,
and
working
himself
up,
no
doubt,
into
a
fury.
Then
the
tragedy
occurred.
I’ve
told
you
all
I
know
myself
now,
for
the
rest
is
mere
surmise
and
conjecture.
We
have
a
good
working
basis,
however,
on
which
to
start.
We
must
hurry
up,
for
I
want
to
go
to
Halle’s
concert
to
hear
Norman
Neruda
this
afternoon.”

This
conversation
had
occurred
while
our
cab
had
been
threading
its
way
through
a
long
succession
of
dingy
streets
and
dreary
by-ways.
In
the
dingiest
and
dreariest
of
them
our
driver
suddenly
came
to
a
stand.
“That’s
Audley
Court
in
there,”
he
said,
pointing
to
a
narrow
slit
in
the
line
of
dead-coloured
brick.
“You’ll
find
me
here
when
you
come
back.”

Audley
Court
was
not
an
attractive
locality.
The
narrow
passage
led
us
into
a
quadrangle
paved
with
flags
and
lined
by
sordid
dwellings.
We
picked
our
way
among
groups
of
dirty
children,
and
through
lines
of
discoloured
linen,
until
we
came
to
Number
46,
the
door
of
which
was
decorated
with
a
small
slip
of
brass
on
which
the
name
Rance
was
engraved.
On
enquiry
we
found
that
the
constable
was
in
bed,
and
we
were
shown
into
a
little
front
parlour
to
await
his
coming.

He
appeared
presently,
looking
a
little
irritable
at
being
disturbed
in
his
slumbers.
“I
made
my
report
at
the
office,”
he
said.

Holmes
took
a
half-sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
played
with
it
pensively.
“We
thought
that
we
should
like
to
hear
it
all
from
your
own
lips,”
he
said.

“I
shall
be
most
happy
to
tell
you
anything
I
can,”
the
constable
answered
with
his
eyes
upon
the
little
golden
disk.

“Just
let
us
hear
it
all
in
your
own
way
as
it
occurred.”

Rance
sat
down
on
the
horsehair
sofa,
and
knitted
his
brows
as
though
determined
not
to
omit
anything
in
his
narrative.

“I’ll
tell
it
ye
from
the
beginning,”
he
said.
“My
time
is
from
ten
at
night
to
six
in
the
morning.
At
eleven
there
was
a
fight
at
the
‘White
Hart’;
but
bar
that
all
was
quiet
enough
on
the
beat.
At
one
o’clock
it
began
to
rain,
and
I
met
Harry
Murcher—him
who
has
the
Holland
Grove
beat—and
we
stood
together
at
the
corner
of
Henrietta
Street
a-talkin’.
Presently—maybe
about
two
or
a
little
after—I
thought
I
would
take
a
look
round
and
see
that
all
was
right
down
the
Brixton
Road.
It
was
precious
dirty
and
lonely.
Not
a
soul
did
I
meet
all
the
way
down,
though
a
cab
or
two
went
past
me.
I
was
a
strollin’
down,
thinkin’
between
ourselves
how
uncommon
handy
a
four
of
gin
hot
would
be,
when
suddenly
the
glint
of
a
light
caught
my
eye
in
the
window
of
that
same
house.
Now,
I
knew
that
them
two
houses
in
Lauriston
Gardens
was
empty
on
account
of
him
that
owns
them
who
won’t
have
the
drains
seen
to,
though
the
very
last
tenant
what
lived
in
one
of
them
died
o’
typhoid
fever.
I
was
knocked
all
in
a
heap
therefore
at
seeing
a
light
in
the
window,
and
I
suspected
as
something
was
wrong.
When
I
got
to
the
door——”

“You
stopped,
and
then
walked
back
to
the
garden
gate,”
my
companion
interrupted.
“What
did
you
do
that
for?”

Rance
gave
a
violent
jump,
and
stared
at
Sherlock
Holmes
with
the
utmost
amazement
upon
his
features.

“Why,
that’s
true,
sir,”
he
said;
“though
how
you
come
to
know
it,
Heaven
only
knows.
Ye
see,
when
I
got
up
to
the
door
it
was
so
still
and
so
lonesome,
that
I
thought
I’d
be
none
the
worse
for
some
one
with
me.
I
ain’t
afeared
of
anything
on
this
side
o’
the
grave;
but
I
thought
that
maybe
it
was
him
that
died
o’
the
typhoid
inspecting
the
drains
what
killed
him.
The
thought
gave
me
a
kind
o’
turn,
and
I
walked
back
to
the
gate
to
see
if
I
could
see
Murcher’s
lantern,
but
there
wasn’t
no
sign
of
him
nor
of
anyone
else.”

“There
was
no
one
in
the
street?”

“Not
a
livin’
soul,
sir,
nor
as
much
as
a
dog.
Then
I
pulled
myself
together
and
went
back
and
pushed
the
door
open.
All
was
quiet
inside,
so
I
went
into
the
room
where
the
light
was
a-burnin’.
There
was
a
candle
flickerin’
on
the
mantelpiece—a
red
wax
one—and
by
its
light
I
saw——”

“Yes,
I
know
all
that
you
saw.
You
walked
round
the
room
several
times,
and
you
knelt
down
by
the
body,
and
then
you
walked
through
and
tried
the
kitchen
door,
and
then——”

John
Rance
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
frightened
face
and
suspicion
in
his
eyes.
“Where
was
you
hid
to
see
all
that?”
he
cried.
“It
seems
to
me
that
you
knows
a
deal
more
than
you
should.”

Holmes
laughed
and
threw
his
card
across
the
table
to
the
constable.
“Don’t
get
arresting
me
for
the
murder,”
he
said.
“I
am
one
of
the
hounds
and
not
the
wolf;
Mr.
Gregson
or
Mr.
Lestrade
will
answer
for
that.
Go
on,
though.
What
did
you
do
next?”

Rance
resumed
his
seat,
without
however
losing
his
mystified
expression.
“I
went
back
to
the
gate
and
sounded
my
whistle.
That
brought
Murcher
and
two
more
to
the
spot.”

“Was
the
street
empty
then?”

“Well,
it
was,
as
far
as
anybody
that
could
be
of
any
good
goes.”

“What
do
you
mean?”

The
constable’s
features
broadened
into
a
grin.
“I’ve
seen
many
a
drunk
chap
in
my
time,”
he
said,
“but
never
anyone
so
cryin’
drunk
as
that
cove.
He
was
at
the
gate
when
I
came
out,
a-leanin’
up
agin
the
railings,
and
a-singin’
at
the
pitch
o’
his
lungs
about
Columbine’s
New-fangled
Banner,
or
some
such
stuff.
He
couldn’t
stand,
far
less
help.”

“What
sort
of
a
man
was
he?”
asked
Sherlock
Holmes.

John
Rance
appeared
to
be
somewhat
irritated
at
this
digression.
“He
was
an
uncommon
drunk
sort
o’
man,”
he
said.
“He’d
ha’
found
hisself
in
the
station
if
we
hadn’t
been
so
took
up.”

“His
face—his
dress—didn’t
you
notice
them?”
Holmes
broke
in
impatiently.

“I
should
think
I
did
notice
them,
seeing
that
I
had
to
prop
him
up—me
and
Murcher
between
us.
He
was
a
long
chap,
with
a
red
face,
the
lower
part
muffled
round——”

“That
will
do,”
cried
Holmes.
“What
became
of
him?”

“We’d
enough
to
do
without
lookin’
after
him,”
the
policeman
said,
in
an
aggrieved
voice.
“I’ll
wager
he
found
his
way
home
all
right.”

“How
was
he
dressed?”

“A
brown
overcoat.”

“Had
he
a
whip
in
his
hand?”

“A
whip—no.”

“He
must
have
left
it
behind,”
muttered
my
companion.
“You
didn’t
happen
to
see
or
hear
a
cab
after
that?”

“No.”

“There’s
a
half-sovereign
for
you,”
my
companion
said,
standing
up
and
taking
his
hat.
“I
am
afraid,
Rance,
that
you
will
never
rise
in
the
force.
That
head
of
yours
should
be
for
use
as
well
as
ornament.
You
might
have
gained
your
sergeant’s
stripes
last
night.
The
man
whom
you
held
in
your
hands
is
the
man
who
holds
the
clue
of
this
mystery,
and
whom
we
are
seeking.
There
is
no
use
of
arguing
about
it
now;
I
tell
you
that
it
is
so.
Come
along,
Doctor.”

We
started
off
for
the
cab
together,
leaving
our
informant
incredulous,
but
obviously
uncomfortable.

“The
blundering
fool,”
Holmes
said,
bitterly,
as
we
drove
back
to
our
lodgings.
“Just
to
think
of
his
having
such
an
incomparable
bit
of
good
luck,
and
not
taking
advantage
of
it.”

“I
am
rather
in
the
dark
still.
It
is
true
that
the
description
of
this
man
tallies
with
your
idea
of
the
second
party
in
this
mystery.
But
why
should
he
come
back
to
the
house
after
leaving
it?
That
is
not
the
way
of
criminals.”

“The
ring,
man,
the
ring:
that
was
what
he
came
back
for.
If
we
have
no
other
way
of
catching
him,
we
can
always
bait
our
line
with
the
ring.
I
shall
have
him,
Doctor—I’ll
lay
you
two
to
one
that
I
have
him.
I
must
thank
you
for
it
all.
I
might
not
have
gone
but
for
you,
and
so
have
missed
the
finest
study
I
ever
came
across:
a
study
in
scarlet,
eh?
Why
shouldn’t
we
use
a
little
art
jargon.
There’s
the
scarlet
thread
of
murder
running
through
the
colourless
skein
of
life,
and
our
duty
is
to
unravel
it,
and
isolate
it,
and
expose
every
inch
of
it.
And
now
for
lunch,
and
then
for
Norman
Neruda.
Her
attack
and
her
bowing
are
splendid.
What’s
that
little
thing
of
Chopin’s
she
plays
so
magnificently:
Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”

Leaning
back
in
the
cab,
this
amateur
bloodhound
carolled
away
like
a
lark
while
I
meditated
upon
the
many-sidedness
of
the
human
mind.





CHAPTER
V.
OUR
ADVERTISEMENT
BRINGS
A
VISITOR.

OUR
morning’s
exertions
had
been
too
much
for
my
weak
health,
and
I
was
tired
out
in
the
afternoon.
After
Holmes’
departure
for
the
concert,
I
lay
down
upon
the
sofa
and
endeavoured
to
get
a
couple
of
hours’
sleep.
It
was
a
useless
attempt.
My
mind
had
been
too
much
excited
by
all
that
had
occurred,
and
the
strangest
fancies
and
surmises
crowded
into
it.
Every
time
that
I
closed
my
eyes
I
saw
before
me
the
distorted
baboon-like
countenance
of
the
murdered
man.
So
sinister
was
the
impression
which
that
face
had
produced
upon
me
that
I
found
it
difficult
to
feel
anything
but
gratitude
for
him
who
had
removed
its
owner
from
the
world.
If
ever
human
features
bespoke
vice
of
the
most
malignant
type,
they
were
certainly
those
of
Enoch
J.
Drebber,
of
Cleveland.
Still
I
recognized
that
justice
must
be
done,
and
that
the
depravity
of
the
victim
was
no
condonment
11
in
the
eyes
of
the
law.

The
more
I
thought
of
it
the
more
extraordinary
did
my
companion’s
hypothesis,
that
the
man
had
been
poisoned,
appear.
I
remembered
how
he
had
sniffed
his
lips,
and
had
no
doubt
that
he
had
detected
something
which
had
given
rise
to
the
idea.
Then,
again,
if
not
poison,
what
had
caused
the
man’s
death,
since
there
was
neither
wound
nor
marks
of
strangulation?
But,
on
the
other
hand,
whose
blood
was
that
which
lay
so
thickly
upon
the
floor?
There
were
no
signs
of
a
struggle,
nor
had
the
victim
any
weapon
with
which
he
might
have
wounded
an
antagonist.
As
long
as
all
these
questions
were
unsolved,
I
felt
that
sleep
would
be
no
easy
matter,
either
for
Holmes
or
myself.
His
quiet
self-confident
manner
convinced
me
that
he
had
already
formed
a
theory
which
explained
all
the
facts,
though
what
it
was
I
could
not
for
an
instant
conjecture.

He
was
very
late
in
returning—so
late,
that
I
knew
that
the
concert
could
not
have
detained
him
all
the
time.
Dinner
was
on
the
table
before
he
appeared.

“It
was
magnificent,”
he
said,
as
he
took
his
seat.
“Do
you
remember
what
Darwin
says
about
music?
He
claims
that
the
power
of
producing
and
appreciating
it
existed
among
the
human
race
long
before
the
power
of
speech
was
arrived
at.
Perhaps
that
is
why
we
are
so
subtly
influenced
by
it.
There
are
vague
memories
in
our
souls
of
those
misty
centuries
when
the
world
was
in
its
childhood.”

“That’s
rather
a
broad
idea,”
I
remarked.

“One’s
ideas
must
be
as
broad
as
Nature
if
they
are
to
interpret
Nature,”
he
answered.
“What’s
the
matter?
You’re
not
looking
quite
yourself.
This
Brixton
Road
affair
has
upset
you.”

“To
tell
the
truth,
it
has,”
I
said.
“I
ought
to
be
more
case-hardened
after
my
Afghan
experiences.
I
saw
my
own
comrades
hacked
to
pieces
at
Maiwand
without
losing
my
nerve.”

“I
can
understand.
There
is
a
mystery
about
this
which
stimulates
the
imagination;
where
there
is
no
imagination
there
is
no
horror.
Have
you
seen
the
evening
paper?”

“No.”

“It
gives
a
fairly
good
account
of
the
affair.
It
does
not
mention
the
fact
that
when
the
man
was
raised
up,
a
woman’s
wedding
ring
fell
upon
the
floor.
It
is
just
as
well
it
does
not.”

“Why?”

“Look
at
this
advertisement,”
he
answered.
“I
had
one
sent
to
every
paper
this
morning
immediately
after
the
affair.”

He
threw
the
paper
across
to
me
and
I
glanced
at
the
place
indicated.
It
was
the
first
announcement
in
the
“Found”
column.
“In
Brixton
Road,
this
morning,”
it
ran,
“a
plain
gold
wedding
ring,
found
in
the
roadway
between
the
‘White
Hart’
Tavern
and
Holland
Grove.
Apply
Dr.
Watson,
221B,
Baker
Street,
between
eight
and
nine
this
evening.”

“Excuse
my
using
your
name,”
he
said.
“If
I
used
my
own
some
of
these
dunderheads
would
recognize
it,
and
want
to
meddle
in
the
affair.”

“That
is
all
right,”
I
answered.
“But
supposing
anyone
applies,
I
have
no
ring.”

“Oh
yes,
you
have,”
said
he,
handing
me
one.
“This
will
do
very
well.
It
is
almost
a
facsimile.”

“And
who
do
you
expect
will
answer
this
advertisement.”

“Why,
the
man
in
the
brown
coat—our
florid
friend
with
the
square
toes.
If
he
does
not
come
himself
he
will
send
an
accomplice.”

“Would
he
not
consider
it
as
too
dangerous?”

“Not
at
all.
If
my
view
of
the
case
is
correct,
and
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
is,
this
man
would
rather
risk
anything
than
lose
the
ring.
According
to
my
notion
he
dropped
it
while
stooping
over
Drebber’s
body,
and
did
not
miss
it
at
the
time.
After
leaving
the
house
he
discovered
his
loss
and
hurried
back,
but
found
the
police
already
in
possession,
owing
to
his
own
folly
in
leaving
the
candle
burning.
He
had
to
pretend
to
be
drunk
in
order
to
allay
the
suspicions
which
might
have
been
aroused
by
his
appearance
at
the
gate.
Now
put
yourself
in
that
man’s
place.
On
thinking
the
matter
over,
it
must
have
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
possible
that
he
had
lost
the
ring
in
the
road
after
leaving
the
house.
What
would
he
do,
then?
He
would
eagerly
look
out
for
the
evening
papers
in
the
hope
of
seeing
it
among
the
articles
found.
His
eye,
of
course,
would
light
upon
this.
He
would
be
overjoyed.
Why
should
he
fear
a
trap?
There
would
be
no
reason
in
his
eyes
why
the
finding
of
the
ring
should
be
connected
with
the
murder.
He
would
come.
He
will
come.
You
shall
see
him
within
an
hour?”

“And
then?”
I
asked.

“Oh,
you
can
leave
me
to
deal
with
him
then.
Have
you
any
arms?”

“I
have
my
old
service
revolver
and
a
few
cartridges.”

“You
had
better
clean
it
and
load
it.
He
will
be
a
desperate
man,
and
though
I
shall
take
him
unawares,
it
is
as
well
to
be
ready
for
anything.”

I
went
to
my
bedroom
and
followed
his
advice.
When
I
returned
with
the
pistol
the
table
had
been
cleared,
and
Holmes
was
engaged
in
his
favourite
occupation
of
scraping
upon
his
violin.

“The
plot
thickens,”
he
said,
as
I
entered;
“I
have
just
had
an
answer
to
my
American
telegram.
My
view
of
the
case
is
the
correct
one.”

“And
that
is?”
I
asked
eagerly.

“My
fiddle
would
be
the
better
for
new
strings,”
he
remarked.
“Put
your
pistol
in
your
pocket.
When
the
fellow
comes
speak
to
him
in
an
ordinary
way.
Leave
the
rest
to
me.
Don’t
frighten
him
by
looking
at
him
too
hard.”

“It
is
eight
o’clock
now,”
I
said,
glancing
at
my
watch.

“Yes.
He
will
probably
be
here
in
a
few
minutes.
Open
the
door
slightly.
That
will
do.
Now
put
the
key
on
the
inside.
Thank
you!
This
is
a
queer
old
book
I
picked
up
at
a
stall
yesterday—‘De
Jure
inter
Gentes’—published
in
Latin
at
Liege
in
the
Lowlands,
in
1642.
Charles’
head
was
still
firm
on
his
shoulders
when
this
little
brown-backed
volume
was
struck
off.”

“Who
is
the
printer?”

“Philippe
de
Croy,
whoever
he
may
have
been.
On
the
fly-leaf,
in
very
faded
ink,
is
written
‘Ex
libris
Guliolmi
Whyte.’
I
wonder
who
William
Whyte
was.
Some
pragmatical
seventeenth
century
lawyer,
I
suppose.
His
writing
has
a
legal
twist
about
it.
Here
comes
our
man,
I
think.”

As
he
spoke
there
was
a
sharp
ring
at
the
bell.
Sherlock
Holmes
rose
softly
and
moved
his
chair
in
the
direction
of
the
door.
We
heard
the
servant
pass
along
the
hall,
and
the
sharp
click
of
the
latch
as
she
opened
it.

“Does
Dr.
Watson
live
here?”
asked
a
clear
but
rather
harsh
voice.
We
could
not
hear
the
servant’s
reply,
but
the
door
closed,
and
some
one
began
to
ascend
the
stairs.
The
footfall
was
an
uncertain
and
shuffling
one.
A
look
of
surprise
passed
over
the
face
of
my
companion
as
he
listened
to
it.
It
came
slowly
along
the
passage,
and
there
was
a
feeble
tap
at
the
door.

“Come
in,”
I
cried.

At
my
summons,
instead
of
the
man
of
violence
whom
we
expected,
a
very
old
and
wrinkled
woman
hobbled
into
the
apartment.
She
appeared
to
be
dazzled
by
the
sudden
blaze
of
light,
and
after
dropping
a
curtsey,
she
stood
blinking
at
us
with
her
bleared
eyes
and
fumbling
in
her
pocket
with
nervous,
shaky
fingers.
I
glanced
at
my
companion,
and
his
face
had
assumed
such
a
disconsolate
expression
that
it
was
all
I
could
do
to
keep
my
countenance.

The
old
crone
drew
out
an
evening
paper,
and
pointed
at
our
advertisement.
“It’s
this
as
has
brought
me,
good
gentlemen,”
she
said,
dropping
another
curtsey;
“a
gold
wedding
ring
in
the
Brixton
Road.
It
belongs
to
my
girl
Sally,
as
was
married
only
this
time
twelvemonth,
which
her
husband
is
steward
aboard
a
Union
boat,
and
what
he’d
say
if
he
come
‘ome
and
found
her
without
her
ring
is
more
than
I
can
think,
he
being
short
enough
at
the
best
o’
times,
but
more
especially
when
he
has
the
drink.
If
it
please
you,
she
went
to
the
circus
last
night
along
with——”

“Is
that
her
ring?”
I
asked.

“The
Lord
be
thanked!”
cried
the
old
woman;
“Sally
will
be
a
glad
woman
this
night.
That’s
the
ring.”

“And
what
may
your
address
be?”
I
inquired,
taking
up
a
pencil.

“13,
Duncan
Street,
Houndsditch.
A
weary
way
from
here.”

“The
Brixton
Road
does
not
lie
between
any
circus
and
Houndsditch,”
said
Sherlock
Holmes
sharply.

The
old
woman
faced
round
and
looked
keenly
at
him
from
her
little
red-rimmed
eyes.
“The
gentleman
asked
me
for
my
address,”
she
said.
“Sally
lives
in
lodgings
at
3,
Mayfield
Place,
Peckham.”

“And
your
name
is——?”

“My
name
is
Sawyer—her’s
is
Dennis,
which
Tom
Dennis
married
her—and
a
smart,
clean
lad,
too,
as
long
as
he’s
at
sea,
and
no
steward
in
the
company
more
thought
of;
but
when
on
shore,
what
with
the
women
and
what
with
liquor
shops——”

“Here
is
your
ring,
Mrs.
Sawyer,”
I
interrupted,
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
my
companion;
“it
clearly
belongs
to
your
daughter,
and
I
am
glad
to
be
able
to
restore
it
to
the
rightful
owner.”

With
many
mumbled
blessings
and
protestations
of
gratitude
the
old
crone
packed
it
away
in
her
pocket,
and
shuffled
off
down
the
stairs.
Sherlock
Holmes
sprang
to
his
feet
the
moment
that
she
was
gone
and
rushed
into
his
room.
He
returned
in
a
few
seconds
enveloped
in
an
ulster
and
a
cravat.
“I’ll
follow
her,”
he
said,
hurriedly;
“she
must
be
an
accomplice,
and
will
lead
me
to
him.
Wait
up
for
me.”
The
hall
door
had
hardly
slammed
behind
our
visitor
before
Holmes
had
descended
the
stair.
Looking
through
the
window
I
could
see
her
walking
feebly
along
the
other
side,
while
her
pursuer
dogged
her
some
little
distance
behind.
“Either
his
whole
theory
is
incorrect,”
I
thought
to
myself,
“or
else
he
will
be
led
now
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery.”
There
was
no
need
for
him
to
ask
me
to
wait
up
for
him,
for
I
felt
that
sleep
was
impossible
until
I
heard
the
result
of
his
adventure.

It
was
close
upon
nine
when
he
set
out.
I
had
no
idea
how
long
he
might
be,
but
I
sat
stolidly
puffing
at
my
pipe
and
skipping
over
the
pages
of
Henri
Murger’s
“Vie
de
Bohème.”
Ten
o’clock
passed,
and
I
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
maid
as
they
pattered
off
to
bed.
Eleven,
and
the
more
stately
tread
of
the
landlady
passed
my
door,
bound
for
the
same
destination.
It
was
close
upon
twelve
before
I
heard
the
sharp
sound
of
his
latch-key.
The
instant
he
entered
I
saw
by
his
face
that
he
had
not
been
successful.
Amusement
and
chagrin
seemed
to
be
struggling
for
the
mastery,
until
the
former
suddenly
carried
the
day,
and
he
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh.

“I
wouldn’t
have
the
Scotland
Yarders
know
it
for
the
world,”
he
cried,
dropping
into
his
chair;
“I
have
chaffed
them
so
much
that
they
would
never
have
let
me
hear
the
end
of
it.
I
can
afford
to
laugh,
because
I
know
that
I
will
be
even
with
them
in
the
long
run.”

“What
is
it
then?”
I
asked.

“Oh,
I
don’t
mind
telling
a
story
against
myself.
That
creature
had
gone
a
little
way
when
she
began
to
limp
and
show
every
sign
of
being
foot-sore.
Presently
she
came
to
a
halt,
and
hailed
a
four-wheeler
which
was
passing.
I
managed
to
be
close
to
her
so
as
to
hear
the
address,
but
I
need
not
have
been
so
anxious,
for
she
sang
it
out
loud
enough
to
be
heard
at
the
other
side
of
the
street,
‘Drive
to
13,
Duncan
Street,
Houndsditch,’
she
cried.
This
begins
to
look
genuine,
I
thought,
and
having
seen
her
safely
inside,
I
perched
myself
behind.
That’s
an
art
which
every
detective
should
be
an
expert
at.
Well,
away
we
rattled,
and
never
drew
rein
until
we
reached
the
street
in
question.
I
hopped
off
before
we
came
to
the
door,
and
strolled
down
the
street
in
an
easy,
lounging
way.
I
saw
the
cab
pull
up.
The
driver
jumped
down,
and
I
saw
him
open
the
door
and
stand
expectantly.
Nothing
came
out
though.
When
I
reached
him
he
was
groping
about
frantically
in
the
empty
cab,
and
giving
vent
to
the
finest
assorted
collection
of
oaths
that
ever
I
listened
to.
There
was
no
sign
or
trace
of
his
passenger,
and
I
fear
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
gets
his
fare.
On
inquiring
at
Number
13
we
found
that
the
house
belonged
to
a
respectable
paperhanger,
named
Keswick,
and
that
no
one
of
the
name
either
of
Sawyer
or
Dennis
had
ever
been
heard
of
there.”

“You
don’t
mean
to
say,”
I
cried,
in
amazement,
“that
that
tottering,
feeble
old
woman
was
able
to
get
out
of
the
cab
while
it
was
in
motion,
without
either
you
or
the
driver
seeing
her?”

“Old
woman
be
damned!”
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
sharply.
“We
were
the
old
women
to
be
so
taken
in.
It
must
have
been
a
young
man,
and
an
active
one,
too,
besides
being
an
incomparable
actor.
The
get-up
was
inimitable.
He
saw
that
he
was
followed,
no
doubt,
and
used
this
means
of
giving
me
the
slip.
It
shows
that
the
man
we
are
after
is
not
as
lonely
as
I
imagined
he
was,
but
has
friends
who
are
ready
to
risk
something
for
him.
Now,
Doctor,
you
are
looking
done-up.
Take
my
advice
and
turn
in.”

I
was
certainly
feeling
very
weary,
so
I
obeyed
his
injunction.
I
left
Holmes
seated
in
front
of
the
smouldering
fire,
and
long
into
the
watches
of
the
night
I
heard
the
low,
melancholy
wailings
of
his
violin,
and
knew
that
he
was
still
pondering
over
the
strange
problem
which
he
had
set
himself
to
unravel.





CHAPTER
VI.
TOBIAS
GREGSON
SHOWS
WHAT
HE
CAN
DO.

THE
papers
next
day
were
full
of
the
“Brixton
Mystery,”
as
they
termed
it.
Each
had
a
long
account
of
the
affair,
and
some
had
leaders
upon
it
in
addition.
There
was
some
information
in
them
which
was
new
to
me.
I
still
retain
in
my
scrap-book
numerous
clippings
and
extracts
bearing
upon
the
case.
Here
is
a
condensation
of
a
few
of
them:—

The
Daily
Telegraph
remarked
that
in
the
history
of
crime
there
had
seldom
been
a
tragedy
which
presented
stranger
features.
The
German
name
of
the
victim,
the
absence
of
all
other
motive,
and
the
sinister
inscription
on
the
wall,
all
pointed
to
its
perpetration
by
political
refugees
and
revolutionists.
The
Socialists
had
many
branches
in
America,
and
the
deceased
had,
no
doubt,
infringed
their
unwritten
laws,
and
been
tracked
down
by
them.
After
alluding
airily
to
the
Vehmgericht,
aqua
tofana,
Carbonari,
the
Marchioness
de
Brinvilliers,
the
Darwinian
theory,
the
principles
of
Malthus,
and
the
Ratcliff
Highway
murders,
the
article
concluded
by
admonishing
the
Government
and
advocating
a
closer
watch
over
foreigners
in
England.

The
Standard
commented
upon
the
fact
that
lawless
outrages
of
the
sort
usually
occurred
under
a
Liberal
Administration.
They
arose
from
the
unsettling
of
the
minds
of
the
masses,
and
the
consequent
weakening
of
all
authority.
The
deceased
was
an
American
gentleman
who
had
been
residing
for
some
weeks
in
the
Metropolis.
He
had
stayed
at
the
boarding-house
of
Madame
Charpentier,
in
Torquay
Terrace,
Camberwell.
He
was
accompanied
in
his
travels
by
his
private
secretary,
Mr.
Joseph
Stangerson.
The
two
bade
adieu
to
their
landlady
upon
Tuesday,
the
4th
inst.,
and
departed
to
Euston
Station
with
the
avowed
intention
of
catching
the
Liverpool
express.
They
were
afterwards
seen
together
upon
the
platform.
Nothing
more
is
known
of
them
until
Mr.
Drebber’s
body
was,
as
recorded,
discovered
in
an
empty
house
in
the
Brixton
Road,
many
miles
from
Euston.
How
he
came
there,
or
how
he
met
his
fate,
are
questions
which
are
still
involved
in
mystery.
Nothing
is
known
of
the
whereabouts
of
Stangerson.
We
are
glad
to
learn
that
Mr.
Lestrade
and
Mr.
Gregson,
of
Scotland
Yard,
are
both
engaged
upon
the
case,
and
it
is
confidently
anticipated
that
these
well-known
officers
will
speedily
throw
light
upon
the
matter.

The
Daily
News
observed
that
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
crime
being
a
political
one.
The
despotism
and
hatred
of
Liberalism
which
animated
the
Continental
Governments
had
had
the
effect
of
driving
to
our
shores
a
number
of
men
who
might
have
made
excellent
citizens
were
they
not
soured
by
the
recollection
of
all
that
they
had
undergone.
Among
these
men
there
was
a
stringent
code
of
honour,
any
infringement
of
which
was
punished
by
death.
Every
effort
should
be
made
to
find
the
secretary,
Stangerson,
and
to
ascertain
some
particulars
of
the
habits
of
the
deceased.
A
great
step
had
been
gained
by
the
discovery
of
the
address
of
the
house
at
which
he
had
boarded—a
result
which
was
entirely
due
to
the
acuteness
and
energy
of
Mr.
Gregson
of
Scotland
Yard.

Sherlock
Holmes
and
I
read
these
notices
over
together
at
breakfast,
and
they
appeared
to
afford
him
considerable
amusement.

“I
told
you
that,
whatever
happened,
Lestrade
and
Gregson
would
be
sure
to
score.”

“That
depends
on
how
it
turns
out.”

“Oh,
bless
you,
it
doesn’t
matter
in
the
least.
If
the
man
is
caught,
it
will
be
on
account
of
their
exertions;
if
he
escapes,
it
will
be
in
spite
of
their
exertions.
It’s
heads
I
win
and
tails
you
lose.
Whatever
they
do,
they
will
have
followers.
‘Un
sot
trouve
toujours
un
plus
sot
qui
l’admire.’”

“What
on
earth
is
this?”
I
cried,
for
at
this
moment
there
came
the
pattering
of
many
steps
in
the
hall
and
on
the
stairs,
accompanied
by
audible
expressions
of
disgust
upon
the
part
of
our
landlady.

“It’s
the
Baker
Street
division
of
the
detective
police
force,”
said
my
companion,
gravely;
and
as
he
spoke
there
rushed
into
the
room
half
a
dozen
of
the
dirtiest
and
most
ragged
street
Arabs
that
ever
I
clapped
eyes
on.

“‘Tention!”
cried
Holmes,
in
a
sharp
tone,
and
the
six
dirty
little
scoundrels
stood
in
a
line
like
so
many
disreputable
statuettes.
“In
future
you
shall
send
up
Wiggins
alone
to
report,
and
the
rest
of
you
must
wait
in
the
street.
Have
you
found
it,
Wiggins?”

“No,
sir,
we
hain’t,”
said
one
of
the
youths.

“I
hardly
expected
you
would.
You
must
keep
on
until
you
do.
Here
are
your
wages.”
13
He
handed
each
of
them
a
shilling.

“Now,
off
you
go,
and
come
back
with
a
better
report
next
time.”

He
waved
his
hand,
and
they
scampered
away
downstairs
like
so
many
rats,
and
we
heard
their
shrill
voices
next
moment
in
the
street.

“There’s
more
work
to
be
got
out
of
one
of
those
little
beggars
than
out
of
a
dozen
of
the
force,”
Holmes
remarked.
“The
mere
sight
of
an
official-looking
person
seals
men’s
lips.
These
youngsters,
however,
go
everywhere
and
hear
everything.
They
are
as
sharp
as
needles,
too;
all
they
want
is
organisation.”

“Is
it
on
this
Brixton
case
that
you
are
employing
them?”
I
asked.

“Yes;
there
is
a
point
which
I
wish
to
ascertain.
It
is
merely
a
matter
of
time.
Hullo!
we
are
going
to
hear
some
news
now
with
a
vengeance!
Here
is
Gregson
coming
down
the
road
with
beatitude
written
upon
every
feature
of
his
face.
Bound
for
us,
I
know.
Yes,
he
is
stopping.
There
he
is!”

There
was
a
violent
peal
at
the
bell,
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
fair-haired
detective
came
up
the
stairs,
three
steps
at
a
time,
and
burst
into
our
sitting-room.

“My
dear
fellow,”
he
cried,
wringing
Holmes’
unresponsive
hand,
“congratulate
me!
I
have
made
the
whole
thing
as
clear
as
day.”

A
shade
of
anxiety
seemed
to
me
to
cross
my
companion’s
expressive
face.

“Do
you
mean
that
you
are
on
the
right
track?”
he
asked.

“The
right
track!
Why,
sir,
we
have
the
man
under
lock
and
key.”

“And
his
name
is?”

“Arthur
Charpentier,
sub-lieutenant
in
Her
Majesty’s
navy,”
cried
Gregson,
pompously,
rubbing
his
fat
hands
and
inflating
his
chest.

Sherlock
Holmes
gave
a
sigh
of
relief,
and
relaxed
into
a
smile.

“Take
a
seat,
and
try
one
of
these
cigars,”
he
said.
“We
are
anxious
to
know
how
you
managed
it.
Will
you
have
some
whiskey
and
water?”

“I
don’t
mind
if
I
do,”
the
detective
answered.
“The
tremendous
exertions
which
I
have
gone
through
during
the
last
day
or
two
have
worn
me
out.
Not
so
much
bodily
exertion,
you
understand,
as
the
strain
upon
the
mind.
You
will
appreciate
that,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
for
we
are
both
brain-workers.”

“You
do
me
too
much
honour,”
said
Holmes,
gravely.
“Let
us
hear
how
you
arrived
at
this
most
gratifying
result.”

The
detective
seated
himself
in
the
arm-chair,
and
puffed
complacently
at
his
cigar.
Then
suddenly
he
slapped
his
thigh
in
a
paroxysm
of
amusement.

“The
fun
of
it
is,”
he
cried,
“that
that
fool
Lestrade,
who
thinks
himself
so
smart,
has
gone
off
upon
the
wrong
track
altogether.
He
is
after
the
secretary
Stangerson,
who
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
crime
than
the
babe
unborn.
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
has
caught
him
by
this
time.”

The
idea
tickled
Gregson
so
much
that
he
laughed
until
he
choked.

“And
how
did
you
get
your
clue?”

“Ah,
I’ll
tell
you
all
about
it.
Of
course,
Doctor
Watson,
this
is
strictly
between
ourselves.
The
first
difficulty
which
we
had
to
contend
with
was
the
finding
of
this
American’s
antecedents.
Some
people
would
have
waited
until
their
advertisements
were
answered,
or
until
parties
came
forward
and
volunteered
information.
That
is
not
Tobias
Gregson’s
way
of
going
to
work.
You
remember
the
hat
beside
the
dead
man?”

“Yes,”
said
Holmes;
“by
John
Underwood
and
Sons,
129,
Camberwell
Road.”

Gregson
looked
quite
crest-fallen.

“I
had
no
idea
that
you
noticed
that,”
he
said.
“Have
you
been
there?”

“No.”

“Ha!”
cried
Gregson,
in
a
relieved
voice;
“you
should
never
neglect
a
chance,
however
small
it
may
seem.”

“To
a
great
mind,
nothing
is
little,”
remarked
Holmes,
sententiously.

“Well,
I
went
to
Underwood,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
sold
a
hat
of
that
size
and
description.
He
looked
over
his
books,
and
came
on
it
at
once.
He
had
sent
the
hat
to
a
Mr.
Drebber,
residing
at
Charpentier’s
Boarding
Establishment,
Torquay
Terrace.
Thus
I
got
at
his
address.”

“Smart—very
smart!”
murmured
Sherlock
Holmes.

“I
next
called
upon
Madame
Charpentier,”
continued
the
detective.
“I
found
her
very
pale
and
distressed.
Her
daughter
was
in
the
room,
too—an
uncommonly
fine
girl
she
is,
too;
she
was
looking
red
about
the
eyes
and
her
lips
trembled
as
I
spoke
to
her.
That
didn’t
escape
my
notice.
I
began
to
smell
a
rat.
You
know
the
feeling,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
when
you
come
upon
the
right
scent—a
kind
of
thrill
in
your
nerves.
‘Have
you
heard
of
the
mysterious
death
of
your
late
boarder
Mr.
Enoch
J.
Drebber,
of
Cleveland?’
I
asked.

“The
mother
nodded.
She
didn’t
seem
able
to
get
out
a
word.
The
daughter
burst
into
tears.
I
felt
more
than
ever
that
these
people
knew
something
of
the
matter.

“‘At
what
o’clock
did
Mr.
Drebber
leave
your
house
for
the
train?’
I
asked.

“‘At
eight
o’clock,’
she
said,
gulping
in
her
throat
to
keep
down
her
agitation.
‘His
secretary,
Mr.
Stangerson,
said
that
there
were
two
trains—one
at
9.15
and
one
at
11.
He
was
to
catch
the
first.
14

“‘And
was
that
the
last
which
you
saw
of
him?’

“A
terrible
change
came
over
the
woman’s
face
as
I
asked
the
question.
Her
features
turned
perfectly
livid.
It
was
some
seconds
before
she
could
get
out
the
single
word
‘Yes’—and
when
it
did
come
it
was
in
a
husky
unnatural
tone.

“There
was
silence
for
a
moment,
and
then
the
daughter
spoke
in
a
calm
clear
voice.

“‘No
good
can
ever
come
of
falsehood,
mother,’
she
said.
‘Let
us
be
frank
with
this
gentleman.
We
did
see
Mr.
Drebber
again.’

“‘God
forgive
you!’
cried
Madame
Charpentier,
throwing
up
her
hands
and
sinking
back
in
her
chair.
‘You
have
murdered
your
brother.’

“‘Arthur
would
rather
that
we
spoke
the
truth,’
the
girl
answered
firmly.

“‘You
had
best
tell
me
all
about
it
now,’
I
said.
‘Half-confidences
are
worse
than
none.
Besides,
you
do
not
know
how
much
we
know
of
it.’

“‘On
your
head
be
it,
Alice!’
cried
her
mother;
and
then,
turning
to
me,
‘I
will
tell
you
all,
sir.
Do
not
imagine
that
my
agitation
on
behalf
of
my
son
arises
from
any
fear
lest
he
should
have
had
a
hand
in
this
terrible
affair.
He
is
utterly
innocent
of
it.
My
dread
is,
however,
that
in
your
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
others
he
may
appear
to
be
compromised.
That
however
is
surely
impossible.
His
high
character,
his
profession,
his
antecedents
would
all
forbid
it.’

“‘Your
best
way
is
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
facts,’
I
answered.
‘Depend
upon
it,
if
your
son
is
innocent
he
will
be
none
the
worse.’

“‘Perhaps,
Alice,
you
had
better
leave
us
together,’
she
said,
and
her
daughter
withdrew.
‘Now,
sir,’
she
continued,
‘I
had
no
intention
of
telling
you
all
this,
but
since
my
poor
daughter
has
disclosed
it
I
have
no
alternative.
Having
once
decided
to
speak,
I
will
tell
you
all
without
omitting
any
particular.’

“‘It
is
your
wisest
course,’
said
I.

“‘Mr.
Drebber
has
been
with
us
nearly
three
weeks.
He
and
his
secretary,
Mr.
Stangerson,
had
been
travelling
on
the
Continent.
I
noticed
a
“Copenhagen”
label
upon
each
of
their
trunks,
showing
that
that
had
been
their
last
stopping
place.
Stangerson
was
a
quiet
reserved
man,
but
his
employer,
I
am
sorry
to
say,
was
far
otherwise.
He
was
coarse
in
his
habits
and
brutish
in
his
ways.
The
very
night
of
his
arrival
he
became
very
much
the
worse
for
drink,
and,
indeed,
after
twelve
o’clock
in
the
day
he
could
hardly
ever
be
said
to
be
sober.
His
manners
towards
the
maid-servants
were
disgustingly
free
and
familiar.
Worst
of
all,
he
speedily
assumed
the
same
attitude
towards
my
daughter,
Alice,
and
spoke
to
her
more
than
once
in
a
way
which,
fortunately,
she
is
too
innocent
to
understand.
On
one
occasion
he
actually
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
embraced
her—an
outrage
which
caused
his
own
secretary
to
reproach
him
for
his
unmanly
conduct.’

“‘But
why
did
you
stand
all
this,’
I
asked.
‘I
suppose
that
you
can
get
rid
of
your
boarders
when
you
wish.’

“Mrs.
Charpentier
blushed
at
my
pertinent
question.
‘Would
to
God
that
I
had
given
him
notice
on
the
very
day
that
he
came,’
she
said.
‘But
it
was
a
sore
temptation.
They
were
paying
a
pound
a
day
each—fourteen
pounds
a
week,
and
this
is
the
slack
season.
I
am
a
widow,
and
my
boy
in
the
Navy
has
cost
me
much.
I
grudged
to
lose
the
money.
I
acted
for
the
best.
This
last
was
too
much,
however,
and
I
gave
him
notice
to
leave
on
account
of
it.
That
was
the
reason
of
his
going.’

“‘Well?’

“‘My
heart
grew
light
when
I
saw
him
drive
away.
My
son
is
on
leave
just
now,
but
I
did
not
tell
him
anything
of
all
this,
for
his
temper
is
violent,
and
he
is
passionately
fond
of
his
sister.
When
I
closed
the
door
behind
them
a
load
seemed
to
be
lifted
from
my
mind.
Alas,
in
less
than
an
hour
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell,
and
I
learned
that
Mr.
Drebber
had
returned.
He
was
much
excited,
and
evidently
the
worse
for
drink.
He
forced
his
way
into
the
room,
where
I
was
sitting
with
my
daughter,
and
made
some
incoherent
remark
about
having
missed
his
train.
He
then
turned
to
Alice,
and
before
my
very
face,
proposed
to
her
that
she
should
fly
with
him.
“You
are
of
age,”
he
said,
“and
there
is
no
law
to
stop
you.
I
have
money
enough
and
to
spare.
Never
mind
the
old
girl
here,
but
come
along
with
me
now
straight
away.
You
shall
live
like
a
princess.”
Poor
Alice
was
so
frightened
that
she
shrunk
away
from
him,
but
he
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
endeavoured
to
draw
her
towards
the
door.
I
screamed,
and
at
that
moment
my
son
Arthur
came
into
the
room.
What
happened
then
I
do
not
know.
I
heard
oaths
and
the
confused
sounds
of
a
scuffle.
I
was
too
terrified
to
raise
my
head.
When
I
did
look
up
I
saw
Arthur
standing
in
the
doorway
laughing,
with
a
stick
in
his
hand.
“I
don’t
think
that
fine
fellow
will
trouble
us
again,”
he
said.
“I
will
just
go
after
him
and
see
what
he
does
with
himself.”
With
those
words
he
took
his
hat
and
started
off
down
the
street.
The
next
morning
we
heard
of
Mr.
Drebber’s
mysterious
death.’

“This
statement
came
from
Mrs.
Charpentier’s
lips
with
many
gasps
and
pauses.
At
times
she
spoke
so
low
that
I
could
hardly
catch
the
words.
I
made
shorthand
notes
of
all
that
she
said,
however,
so
that
there
should
be
no
possibility
of
a
mistake.”

“It’s
quite
exciting,”
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
with
a
yawn.
“What
happened
next?”

“When
Mrs.
Charpentier
paused,”
the
detective
continued,
“I
saw
that
the
whole
case
hung
upon
one
point.
Fixing
her
with
my
eye
in
a
way
which
I
always
found
effective
with
women,
I
asked
her
at
what
hour
her
son
returned.

“‘I
do
not
know,’
she
answered.

“‘Not
know?’

“‘No;
he
has
a
latch-key,
and
he
let
himself
in.’

“‘After
you
went
to
bed?’

“‘Yes.’

“‘When
did
you
go
to
bed?’

“‘About
eleven.’

“‘So
your
son
was
gone
at
least
two
hours?’

“‘Yes.’

“‘Possibly
four
or
five?’

“‘Yes.’

“‘What
was
he
doing
during
that
time?’

“‘I
do
not
know,’
she
answered,
turning
white
to
her
very
lips.

“Of
course
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done.
I
found
out
where
Lieutenant
Charpentier
was,
took
two
officers
with
me,
and
arrested
him.
When
I
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
warned
him
to
come
quietly
with
us,
he
answered
us
as
bold
as
brass,
‘I
suppose
you
are
arresting
me
for
being
concerned
in
the
death
of
that
scoundrel
Drebber,’
he
said.
We
had
said
nothing
to
him
about
it,
so
that
his
alluding
to
it
had
a
most
suspicious
aspect.”

“Very,”
said
Holmes.

“He
still
carried
the
heavy
stick
which
the
mother
described
him
as
having
with
him
when
he
followed
Drebber.
It
was
a
stout
oak
cudgel.”

“What
is
your
theory,
then?”

“Well,
my
theory
is
that
he
followed
Drebber
as
far
as
the
Brixton
Road.
When
there,
a
fresh
altercation
arose
between
them,
in
the
course
of
which
Drebber
received
a
blow
from
the
stick,
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach,
perhaps,
which
killed
him
without
leaving
any
mark.
The
night
was
so
wet
that
no
one
was
about,
so
Charpentier
dragged
the
body
of
his
victim
into
the
empty
house.
As
to
the
candle,
and
the
blood,
and
the
writing
on
the
wall,
and
the
ring,
they
may
all
be
so
many
tricks
to
throw
the
police
on
to
the
wrong
scent.”

“Well
done!”
said
Holmes
in
an
encouraging
voice.
“Really,
Gregson,
you
are
getting
along.
We
shall
make
something
of
you
yet.”

“I
flatter
myself
that
I
have
managed
it
rather
neatly,”
the
detective
answered
proudly.
“The
young
man
volunteered
a
statement,
in
which
he
said
that
after
following
Drebber
some
time,
the
latter
perceived
him,
and
took
a
cab
in
order
to
get
away
from
him.
On
his
way
home
he
met
an
old
shipmate,
and
took
a
long
walk
with
him.
On
being
asked
where
this
old
shipmate
lived,
he
was
unable
to
give
any
satisfactory
reply.
I
think
the
whole
case
fits
together
uncommonly
well.
What
amuses
me
is
to
think
of
Lestrade,
who
had
started
off
upon
the
wrong
scent.
I
am
afraid
he
won’t
make
much
of
15
Why,
by
Jove,
here’s
the
very
man
himself!”

It
was
indeed
Lestrade,
who
had
ascended
the
stairs
while
we
were
talking,
and
who
now
entered
the
room.
The
assurance
and
jauntiness
which
generally
marked
his
demeanour
and
dress
were,
however,
wanting.
His
face
was
disturbed
and
troubled,
while
his
clothes
were
disarranged
and
untidy.
He
had
evidently
come
with
the
intention
of
consulting
with
Sherlock
Holmes,
for
on
perceiving
his
colleague
he
appeared
to
be
embarrassed
and
put
out.
He
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room,
fumbling
nervously
with
his
hat
and
uncertain
what
to
do.
“This
is
a
most
extraordinary
case,”
he
said
at
last—“a
most
incomprehensible
affair.”

“Ah,
you
find
it
so,
Mr.
Lestrade!”
cried
Gregson,
triumphantly.
“I
thought
you
would
come
to
that
conclusion.
Have
you
managed
to
find
the
Secretary,
Mr.
Joseph
Stangerson?”

“The
Secretary,
Mr.
Joseph
Stangerson,”
said
Lestrade
gravely,
“was
murdered
at
Halliday’s
Private
Hotel
about
six
o’clock
this
morning.”





CHAPTER
VII.
LIGHT
IN
THE
DARKNESS.

THE
intelligence
with
which
Lestrade
greeted
us
was
so
momentous
and
so
unexpected,
that
we
were
all
three
fairly
dumfoundered.
Gregson
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
upset
the
remainder
of
his
whiskey
and
water.
I
stared
in
silence
at
Sherlock
Holmes,
whose
lips
were
compressed
and
his
brows
drawn
down
over
his
eyes.

“Stangerson
too!”
he
muttered.
“The
plot
thickens.”

“It
was
quite
thick
enough
before,”
grumbled
Lestrade,
taking
a
chair.
“I
seem
to
have
dropped
into
a
sort
of
council
of
war.”

“Are
you—are
you
sure
of
this
piece
of
intelligence?”
stammered
Gregson.

“I
have
just
come
from
his
room,”
said
Lestrade.
“I
was
the
first
to
discover
what
had
occurred.”

“We
have
been
hearing
Gregson’s
view
of
the
matter,”
Holmes
observed.
“Would
you
mind
letting
us
know
what
you
have
seen
and
done?”

“I
have
no
objection,”
Lestrade
answered,
seating
himself.
“I
freely
confess
that
I
was
of
the
opinion
that
Stangerson
was
concerned
in
the
death
of
Drebber.
This
fresh
development
has
shown
me
that
I
was
completely
mistaken.
Full
of
the
one
idea,
I
set
myself
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
the
Secretary.
They
had
been
seen
together
at
Euston
Station
about
half-past
eight
on
the
evening
of
the
third.
At
two
in
the
morning
Drebber
had
been
found
in
the
Brixton
Road.
The
question
which
confronted
me
was
to
find
out
how
Stangerson
had
been
employed
between
8.30
and
the
time
of
the
crime,
and
what
had
become
of
him
afterwards.
I
telegraphed
to
Liverpool,
giving
a
description
of
the
man,
and
warning
them
to
keep
a
watch
upon
the
American
boats.
I
then
set
to
work
calling
upon
all
the
hotels
and
lodging-houses
in
the
vicinity
of
Euston.
You
see,
I
argued
that
if
Drebber
and
his
companion
had
become
separated,
the
natural
course
for
the
latter
would
be
to
put
up
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
for
the
night,
and
then
to
hang
about
the
station
again
next
morning.”

“They
would
be
likely
to
agree
on
some
meeting-place
beforehand,”
remarked
Holmes.

“So
it
proved.
I
spent
the
whole
of
yesterday
evening
in
making
enquiries
entirely
without
avail.
This
morning
I
began
very
early,
and
at
eight
o’clock
I
reached
Halliday’s
Private
Hotel,
in
Little
George
Street.
On
my
enquiry
as
to
whether
a
Mr.
Stangerson
was
living
there,
they
at
once
answered
me
in
the
affirmative.

“‘No
doubt
you
are
the
gentleman
whom
he
was
expecting,’
they
said.
‘He
has
been
waiting
for
a
gentleman
for
two
days.’

“‘Where
is
he
now?’
I
asked.

“‘He
is
upstairs
in
bed.
He
wished
to
be
called
at
nine.’

“‘I
will
go
up
and
see
him
at
once,’
I
said.

“It
seemed
to
me
that
my
sudden
appearance
might
shake
his
nerves
and
lead
him
to
say
something
unguarded.
The
Boots
volunteered
to
show
me
the
room:
it
was
on
the
second
floor,
and
there
was
a
small
corridor
leading
up
to
it.
The
Boots
pointed
out
the
door
to
me,
and
was
about
to
go
downstairs
again
when
I
saw
something
that
made
me
feel
sickish,
in
spite
of
my
twenty
years’
experience.
From
under
the
door
there
curled
a
little
red
ribbon
of
blood,
which
had
meandered
across
the
passage
and
formed
a
little
pool
along
the
skirting
at
the
other
side.
I
gave
a
cry,
which
brought
the
Boots
back.
He
nearly
fainted
when
he
saw
it.
The
door
was
locked
on
the
inside,
but
we
put
our
shoulders
to
it,
and
knocked
it
in.
The
window
of
the
room
was
open,
and
beside
the
window,
all
huddled
up,
lay
the
body
of
a
man
in
his
nightdress.
He
was
quite
dead,
and
had
been
for
some
time,
for
his
limbs
were
rigid
and
cold.
When
we
turned
him
over,
the
Boots
recognized
him
at
once
as
being
the
same
gentleman
who
had
engaged
the
room
under
the
name
of
Joseph
Stangerson.
The
cause
of
death
was
a
deep
stab
in
the
left
side,
which
must
have
penetrated
the
heart.
And
now
comes
the
strangest
part
of
the
affair.
What
do
you
suppose
was
above
the
murdered
man?”

I
felt
a
creeping
of
the
flesh,
and
a
presentiment
of
coming
horror,
even
before
Sherlock
Holmes
answered.

“The
word
RACHE,
written
in
letters
of
blood,”
he
said.

“That
was
it,”
said
Lestrade,
in
an
awe-struck
voice;
and
we
were
all
silent
for
a
while.

There
was
something
so
methodical
and
so
incomprehensible
about
the
deeds
of
this
unknown
assassin,
that
it
imparted
a
fresh
ghastliness
to
his
crimes.
My
nerves,
which
were
steady
enough
on
the
field
of
battle
tingled
as
I
thought
of
it.

“The
man
was
seen,”
continued
Lestrade.
“A
milk
boy,
passing
on
his
way
to
the
dairy,
happened
to
walk
down
the
lane
which
leads
from
the
mews
at
the
back
of
the
hotel.
He
noticed
that
a
ladder,
which
usually
lay
there,
was
raised
against
one
of
the
windows
of
the
second
floor,
which
was
wide
open.
After
passing,
he
looked
back
and
saw
a
man
descend
the
ladder.
He
came
down
so
quietly
and
openly
that
the
boy
imagined
him
to
be
some
carpenter
or
joiner
at
work
in
the
hotel.
He
took
no
particular
notice
of
him,
beyond
thinking
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
early
for
him
to
be
at
work.
He
has
an
impression
that
the
man
was
tall,
had
a
reddish
face,
and
was
dressed
in
a
long,
brownish
coat.
He
must
have
stayed
in
the
room
some
little
time
after
the
murder,
for
we
found
blood-stained
water
in
the
basin,
where
he
had
washed
his
hands,
and
marks
on
the
sheets
where
he
had
deliberately
wiped
his
knife.”

I
glanced
at
Holmes
on
hearing
the
description
of
the
murderer,
which
tallied
so
exactly
with
his
own.
There
was,
however,
no
trace
of
exultation
or
satisfaction
upon
his
face.

“Did
you
find
nothing
in
the
room
which
could
furnish
a
clue
to
the
murderer?”
he
asked.

“Nothing.
Stangerson
had
Drebber’s
purse
in
his
pocket,
but
it
seems
that
this
was
usual,
as
he
did
all
the
paying.
There
was
eighty
odd
pounds
in
it,
but
nothing
had
been
taken.
Whatever
the
motives
of
these
extraordinary
crimes,
robbery
is
certainly
not
one
of
them.
There
were
no
papers
or
memoranda
in
the
murdered
man’s
pocket,
except
a
single
telegram,
dated
from
Cleveland
about
a
month
ago,
and
containing
the
words,
‘J.
H.
is
in
Europe.’
There
was
no
name
appended
to
this
message.”

“And
there
was
nothing
else?”
Holmes
asked.

“Nothing
of
any
importance.
The
man’s
novel,
with
which
he
had
read
himself
to
sleep
was
lying
upon
the
bed,
and
his
pipe
was
on
a
chair
beside
him.
There
was
a
glass
of
water
on
the
table,
and
on
the
window-sill
a
small
chip
ointment
box
containing
a
couple
of
pills.”

Sherlock
Holmes
sprang
from
his
chair
with
an
exclamation
of
delight.

“The
last
link,”
he
cried,
exultantly.
“My
case
is
complete.”

The
two
detectives
stared
at
him
in
amazement.

“I
have
now
in
my
hands,”
my
companion
said,
confidently,
“all
the
threads
which
have
formed
such
a
tangle.
There
are,
of
course,
details
to
be
filled
in,
but
I
am
as
certain
of
all
the
main
facts,
from
the
time
that
Drebber
parted
from
Stangerson
at
the
station,
up
to
the
discovery
of
the
body
of
the
latter,
as
if
I
had
seen
them
with
my
own
eyes.
I
will
give
you
a
proof
of
my
knowledge.
Could
you
lay
your
hand
upon
those
pills?”

“I
have
them,”
said
Lestrade,
producing
a
small
white
box;
“I
took
them
and
the
purse
and
the
telegram,
intending
to
have
them
put
in
a
place
of
safety
at
the
Police
Station.
It
was
the
merest
chance
my
taking
these
pills,
for
I
am
bound
to
say
that
I
do
not
attach
any
importance
to
them.”

“Give
them
here,”
said
Holmes.
“Now,
Doctor,”
turning
to
me,
“are
those
ordinary
pills?”

They
certainly
were
not.
They
were
of
a
pearly
grey
colour,
small,
round,
and
almost
transparent
against
the
light.
“From
their
lightness
and
transparency,
I
should
imagine
that
they
are
soluble
in
water,”
I
remarked.

“Precisely
so,”
answered
Holmes.
“Now
would
you
mind
going
down
and
fetching
that
poor
little
devil
of
a
terrier
which
has
been
bad
so
long,
and
which
the
landlady
wanted
you
to
put
out
of
its
pain
yesterday.”

I
went
downstairs
and
carried
the
dog
upstair
in
my
arms.
It’s
laboured
breathing
and
glazing
eye
showed
that
it
was
not
far
from
its
end.
Indeed,
its
snow-white
muzzle
proclaimed
that
it
had
already
exceeded
the
usual
term
of
canine
existence.
I
placed
it
upon
a
cushion
on
the
rug.

“I
will
now
cut
one
of
these
pills
in
two,”
said
Holmes,
and
drawing
his
penknife
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word.
“One
half
we
return
into
the
box
for
future
purposes.
The
other
half
I
will
place
in
this
wine
glass,
in
which
is
a
teaspoonful
of
water.
You
perceive
that
our
friend,
the
Doctor,
is
right,
and
that
it
readily
dissolves.”

“This
may
be
very
interesting,”
said
Lestrade,
in
the
injured
tone
of
one
who
suspects
that
he
is
being
laughed
at,
“I
cannot
see,
however,
what
it
has
to
do
with
the
death
of
Mr.
Joseph
Stangerson.”

“Patience,
my
friend,
patience!
You
will
find
in
time
that
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it.
I
shall
now
add
a
little
milk
to
make
the
mixture
palatable,
and
on
presenting
it
to
the
dog
we
find
that
he
laps
it
up
readily
enough.”

As
he
spoke
he
turned
the
contents
of
the
wine
glass
into
a
saucer
and
placed
it
in
front
of
the
terrier,
who
speedily
licked
it
dry.
Sherlock
Holmes’
earnest
demeanour
had
so
far
convinced
us
that
we
all
sat
in
silence,
watching
the
animal
intently,
and
expecting
some
startling
effect.
None
such
appeared,
however.
The
dog
continued
to
lie
stretched
upon
tho
16
cushion,
breathing
in
a
laboured
way,
but
apparently
neither
the
better
nor
the
worse
for
its
draught.

Holmes
had
taken
out
his
watch,
and
as
minute
followed
minute
without
result,
an
expression
of
the
utmost
chagrin
and
disappointment
appeared
upon
his
features.
He
gnawed
his
lip,
drummed
his
fingers
upon
the
table,
and
showed
every
other
symptom
of
acute
impatience.
So
great
was
his
emotion,
that
I
felt
sincerely
sorry
for
him,
while
the
two
detectives
smiled
derisively,
by
no
means
displeased
at
this
check
which
he
had
met.

“It
can’t
be
a
coincidence,”
he
cried,
at
last
springing
from
his
chair
and
pacing
wildly
up
and
down
the
room;
“it
is
impossible
that
it
should
be
a
mere
coincidence.
The
very
pills
which
I
suspected
in
the
case
of
Drebber
are
actually
found
after
the
death
of
Stangerson.
And
yet
they
are
inert.
What
can
it
mean?
Surely
my
whole
chain
of
reasoning
cannot
have
been
false.
It
is
impossible!
And
yet
this
wretched
dog
is
none
the
worse.
Ah,
I
have
it!
I
have
it!”
With
a
perfect
shriek
of
delight
he
rushed
to
the
box,
cut
the
other
pill
in
two,
dissolved
it,
added
milk,
and
presented
it
to
the
terrier.
The
unfortunate
creature’s
tongue
seemed
hardly
to
have
been
moistened
in
it
before
it
gave
a
convulsive
shiver
in
every
limb,
and
lay
as
rigid
and
lifeless
as
if
it
had
been
struck
by
lightning.

Sherlock
Holmes
drew
a
long
breath,
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead.
“I
should
have
more
faith,”
he
said;
“I
ought
to
know
by
this
time
that
when
a
fact
appears
to
be
opposed
to
a
long
train
of
deductions,
it
invariably
proves
to
be
capable
of
bearing
some
other
interpretation.
Of
the
two
pills
in
that
box
one
was
of
the
most
deadly
poison,
and
the
other
was
entirely
harmless.
I
ought
to
have
known
that
before
ever
I
saw
the
box
at
all.”

This
last
statement
appeared
to
me
to
be
so
startling,
that
I
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
in
his
sober
senses.
There
was
the
dead
dog,
however,
to
prove
that
his
conjecture
had
been
correct.
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
mists
in
my
own
mind
were
gradually
clearing
away,
and
I
began
to
have
a
dim,
vague
perception
of
the
truth.

“All
this
seems
strange
to
you,”
continued
Holmes,
“because
you
failed
at
the
beginning
of
the
inquiry
to
grasp
the
importance
of
the
single
real
clue
which
was
presented
to
you.
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
seize
upon
that,
and
everything
which
has
occurred
since
then
has
served
to
confirm
my
original
supposition,
and,
indeed,
was
the
logical
sequence
of
it.
Hence
things
which
have
perplexed
you
and
made
the
case
more
obscure,
have
served
to
enlighten
me
and
to
strengthen
my
conclusions.
It
is
a
mistake
to
confound
strangeness
with
mystery.
The
most
commonplace
crime
is
often
the
most
mysterious
because
it
presents
no
new
or
special
features
from
which
deductions
may
be
drawn.
This
murder
would
have
been
infinitely
more
difficult
to
unravel
had
the
body
of
the
victim
been
simply
found
lying
in
the
roadway
without
any
of
those
outré
and
sensational
accompaniments
which
have
rendered
it
remarkable.
These
strange
details,
far
from
making
the
case
more
difficult,
have
really
had
the
effect
of
making
it
less
so.”

Mr.
Gregson,
who
had
listened
to
this
address
with
considerable
impatience,
could
contain
himself
no
longer.
“Look
here,
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,”
he
said,
“we
are
all
ready
to
acknowledge
that
you
are
a
smart
man,
and
that
you
have
your
own
methods
of
working.
We
want
something
more
than
mere
theory
and
preaching
now,
though.
It
is
a
case
of
taking
the
man.
I
have
made
my
case
out,
and
it
seems
I
was
wrong.
Young
Charpentier
could
not
have
been
engaged
in
this
second
affair.
Lestrade
went
after
his
man,
Stangerson,
and
it
appears
that
he
was
wrong
too.
You
have
thrown
out
hints
here,
and
hints
there,
and
seem
to
know
more
than
we
do,
but
the
time
has
come
when
we
feel
that
we
have
a
right
to
ask
you
straight
how
much
you
do
know
of
the
business.
Can
you
name
the
man
who
did
it?”

“I
cannot
help
feeling
that
Gregson
is
right,
sir,”
remarked
Lestrade.
“We
have
both
tried,
and
we
have
both
failed.
You
have
remarked
more
than
once
since
I
have
been
in
the
room
that
you
had
all
the
evidence
which
you
require.
Surely
you
will
not
withhold
it
any
longer.”

“Any
delay
in
arresting
the
assassin,”
I
observed,
“might
give
him
time
to
perpetrate
some
fresh
atrocity.”

Thus
pressed
by
us
all,
Holmes
showed
signs
of
irresolution.
He
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
head
sunk
on
his
chest
and
his
brows
drawn
down,
as
was
his
habit
when
lost
in
thought.

“There
will
be
no
more
murders,”
he
said
at
last,
stopping
abruptly
and
facing
us.
“You
can
put
that
consideration
out
of
the
question.
You
have
asked
me
if
I
know
the
name
of
the
assassin.
I
do.
The
mere
knowing
of
his
name
is
a
small
thing,
however,
compared
with
the
power
of
laying
our
hands
upon
him.
This
I
expect
very
shortly
to
do.
I
have
good
hopes
of
managing
it
through
my
own
arrangements;
but
it
is
a
thing
which
needs
delicate
handling,
for
we
have
a
shrewd
and
desperate
man
to
deal
with,
who
is
supported,
as
I
have
had
occasion
to
prove,
by
another
who
is
as
clever
as
himself.
As
long
as
this
man
has
no
idea
that
anyone
can
have
a
clue
there
is
some
chance
of
securing
him;
but
if
he
had
the
slightest
suspicion,
he
would
change
his
name,
and
vanish
in
an
instant
among
the
four
million
inhabitants
of
this
great
city.
Without
meaning
to
hurt
either
of
your
feelings,
I
am
bound
to
say
that
I
consider
these
men
to
be
more
than
a
match
for
the
official
force,
and
that
is
why
I
have
not
asked
your
assistance.
If
I
fail
I
shall,
of
course,
incur
all
the
blame
due
to
this
omission;
but
that
I
am
prepared
for.
At
present
I
am
ready
to
promise
that
the
instant
that
I
can
communicate
with
you
without
endangering
my
own
combinations,
I
shall
do
so.”

Gregson
and
Lestrade
seemed
to
be
far
from
satisfied
by
this
assurance,
or
by
the
depreciating
allusion
to
the
detective
police.
The
former
had
flushed
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaxen
hair,
while
the
other’s
beady
eyes
glistened
with
curiosity
and
resentment.
Neither
of
them
had
time
to
speak,
however,
before
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door,
and
the
spokesman
of
the
street
Arabs,
young
Wiggins,
introduced
his
insignificant
and
unsavoury
person.

“Please,
sir,”
he
said,
touching
his
forelock,
“I
have
the
cab
downstairs.”

“Good
boy,”
said
Holmes,
blandly.
“Why
don’t
you
introduce
this
pattern
at
Scotland
Yard?”
he
continued,
taking
a
pair
of
steel
handcuffs
from
a
drawer.
“See
how
beautifully
the
spring
works.
They
fasten
in
an
instant.”

“The
old
pattern
is
good
enough,”
remarked
Lestrade,
“if
we
can
only
find
the
man
to
put
them
on.”

“Very
good,
very
good,”
said
Holmes,
smiling.
“The
cabman
may
as
well
help
me
with
my
boxes.
Just
ask
him
to
step
up,
Wiggins.”

I
was
surprised
to
find
my
companion
speaking
as
though
he
were
about
to
set
out
on
a
journey,
since
he
had
not
said
anything
to
me
about
it.
There
was
a
small
portmanteau
in
the
room,
and
this
he
pulled
out
and
began
to
strap.
He
was
busily
engaged
at
it
when
the
cabman
entered
the
room.

“Just
give
me
a
help
with
this
buckle,
cabman,”
he
said,
kneeling
over
his
task,
and
never
turning
his
head.

The
fellow
came
forward
with
a
somewhat
sullen,
defiant
air,
and
put
down
his
hands
to
assist.
At
that
instant
there
was
a
sharp
click,
the
jangling
of
metal,
and
Sherlock
Holmes
sprang
to
his
feet
again.

“Gentlemen,”
he
cried,
with
flashing
eyes,
“let
me
introduce
you
to
Mr.
Jefferson
Hope,
the
murderer
of
Enoch
Drebber
and
of
Joseph
Stangerson.”

The
whole
thing
occurred
in
a
moment—so
quickly
that
I
had
no
time
to
realize
it.
I
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
that
instant,
of
Holmes’
triumphant
expression
and
the
ring
of
his
voice,
of
the
cabman’s
dazed,
savage
face,
as
he
glared
at
the
glittering
handcuffs,
which
had
appeared
as
if
by
magic
upon
his
wrists.
For
a
second
or
two
we
might
have
been
a
group
of
statues.
Then,
with
an
inarticulate
roar
of
fury,
the
prisoner
wrenched
himself
free
from
Holmes’s
grasp,
and
hurled
himself
through
the
window.
Woodwork
and
glass
gave
way
before
him;
but
before
he
got
quite
through,
Gregson,
Lestrade,
and
Holmes
sprang
upon
him
like
so
many
staghounds.
He
was
dragged
back
into
the
room,
and
then
commenced
a
terrific
conflict.
So
powerful
and
so
fierce
was
he,
that
the
four
of
us
were
shaken
off
again
and
again.
He
appeared
to
have
the
convulsive
strength
of
a
man
in
an
epileptic
fit.
His
face
and
hands
were
terribly
mangled
by
his
passage
through
the
glass,
but
loss
of
blood
had
no
effect
in
diminishing
his
resistance.
It
was
not
until
Lestrade
succeeded
in
getting
his
hand
inside
his
neckcloth
and
half-strangling
him
that
we
made
him
realize
that
his
struggles
were
of
no
avail;
and
even
then
we
felt
no
security
until
we
had
pinioned
his
feet
as
well
as
his
hands.
That
done,
we
rose
to
our
feet
breathless
and
panting.

“We
have
his
cab,”
said
Sherlock
Holmes.
“It
will
serve
to
take
him
to
Scotland
Yard.
And
now,
gentlemen,”
he
continued,
with
a
pleasant
smile,
“we
have
reached
the
end
of
our
little
mystery.
You
are
very
welcome
to
put
any
questions
that
you
like
to
me
now,
and
there
is
no
danger
that
I
will
refuse
to
answer
them.”





PART
II.
The
Country
of
the
Saints.





CHAPTER
I.
ON
THE
GREAT
ALKALI
PLAIN.

IN
the
central
portion
of
the
great
North
American
Continent
there
lies
an
arid
and
repulsive
desert,
which
for
many
a
long
year
served
as
a
barrier
against
the
advance
of
civilisation.
From
the
Sierra
Nevada
to
Nebraska,
and
from
the
Yellowstone
River
in
the
north
to
the
Colorado
upon
the
south,
is
a
region
of
desolation
and
silence.
Nor
is
Nature
always
in
one
mood
throughout
this
grim
district.
It
comprises
snow-capped
and
lofty
mountains,
and
dark
and
gloomy
valleys.
There
are
swift-flowing
rivers
which
dash
through
jagged
cañons;
and
there
are
enormous
plains,
which
in
winter
are
white
with
snow,
and
in
summer
are
grey
with
the
saline
alkali
dust.
They
all
preserve,
however,
the
common
characteristics
of
barrenness,
inhospitality,
and
misery.

There
are
no
inhabitants
of
this
land
of
despair.
A
band
of
Pawnees
or
of
Blackfeet
may
occasionally
traverse
it
in
order
to
reach
other
hunting-grounds,
but
the
hardiest
of
the
braves
are
glad
to
lose
sight
of
those
awesome
plains,
and
to
find
themselves
once
more
upon
their
prairies.
The
coyote
skulks
among
the
scrub,
the
buzzard
flaps
heavily
through
the
air,
and
the
clumsy
grizzly
bear
lumbers
through
the
dark
ravines,
and
picks
up
such
sustenance
as
it
can
amongst
the
rocks.
These
are
the
sole
dwellers
in
the
wilderness.

In
the
whole
world
there
can
be
no
more
dreary
view
than
that
from
the
northern
slope
of
the
Sierra
Blanco.
As
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
stretches
the
great
flat
plain-land,
all
dusted
over
with
patches
of
alkali,
and
intersected
by
clumps
of
the
dwarfish
chaparral
bushes.
On
the
extreme
verge
of
the
horizon
lie
a
long
chain
of
mountain
peaks,
with
their
rugged
summits
flecked
with
snow.
In
this
great
stretch
of
country
there
is
no
sign
of
life,
nor
of
anything
appertaining
to
life.
There
is
no
bird
in
the
steel-blue
heaven,
no
movement
upon
the
dull,
grey
earth—above
all,
there
is
absolute
silence.
Listen
as
one
may,
there
is
no
shadow
of
a
sound
in
all
that
mighty
wilderness;
nothing
but
silence—complete
and
heart-subduing
silence.

It
has
been
said
there
is
nothing
appertaining
to
life
upon
the
broad
plain.
That
is
hardly
true.
Looking
down
from
the
Sierra
Blanco,
one
sees
a
pathway
traced
out
across
the
desert,
which
winds
away
and
is
lost
in
the
extreme
distance.
It
is
rutted
with
wheels
and
trodden
down
by
the
feet
of
many
adventurers.
Here
and
there
there
are
scattered
white
objects
which
glisten
in
the
sun,
and
stand
out
against
the
dull
deposit
of
alkali.
Approach,
and
examine
them!
They
are
bones:
some
large
and
coarse,
others
smaller
and
more
delicate.
The
former
have
belonged
to
oxen,
and
the
latter
to
men.
For
fifteen
hundred
miles
one
may
trace
this
ghastly
caravan
route
by
these
scattered
remains
of
those
who
had
fallen
by
the
wayside.

Looking
down
on
this
very
scene,
there
stood
upon
the
fourth
of
May,
eighteen
hundred
and
forty-seven,
a
solitary
traveller.
His
appearance
was
such
that
he
might
have
been
the
very
genius
or
demon
of
the
region.
An
observer
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
say
whether
he
was
nearer
to
forty
or
to
sixty.
His
face
was
lean
and
haggard,
and
the
brown
parchment-like
skin
was
drawn
tightly
over
the
projecting
bones;
his
long,
brown
hair
and
beard
were
all
flecked
and
dashed
with
white;
his
eyes
were
sunken
in
his
head,
and
burned
with
an
unnatural
lustre;
while
the
hand
which
grasped
his
rifle
was
hardly
more
fleshy
than
that
of
a
skeleton.
As
he
stood,
he
leaned
upon
his
weapon
for
support,
and
yet
his
tall
figure
and
the
massive
framework
of
his
bones
suggested
a
wiry
and
vigorous
constitution.
His
gaunt
face,
however,
and
his
clothes,
which
hung
so
baggily
over
his
shrivelled
limbs,
proclaimed
what
it
was
that
gave
him
that
senile
and
decrepit
appearance.
The
man
was
dying—dying
from
hunger
and
from
thirst.

He
had
toiled
painfully
down
the
ravine,
and
on
to
this
little
elevation,
in
the
vain
hope
of
seeing
some
signs
of
water.
Now
the
great
salt
plain
stretched
before
his
eyes,
and
the
distant
belt
of
savage
mountains,
without
a
sign
anywhere
of
plant
or
tree,
which
might
indicate
the
presence
of
moisture.
In
all
that
broad
landscape
there
was
no
gleam
of
hope.
North,
and
east,
and
west
he
looked
with
wild
questioning
eyes,
and
then
he
realised
that
his
wanderings
had
come
to
an
end,
and
that
there,
on
that
barren
crag,
he
was
about
to
die.
“Why
not
here,
as
well
as
in
a
feather
bed,
twenty
years
hence,”
he
muttered,
as
he
seated
himself
in
the
shelter
of
a
boulder.

Before
sitting
down,
he
had
deposited
upon
the
ground
his
useless
rifle,
and
also
a
large
bundle
tied
up
in
a
grey
shawl,
which
he
had
carried
slung
over
his
right
shoulder.
It
appeared
to
be
somewhat
too
heavy
for
his
strength,
for
in
lowering
it,
it
came
down
on
the
ground
with
some
little
violence.
Instantly
there
broke
from
the
grey
parcel
a
little
moaning
cry,
and
from
it
there
protruded
a
small,
scared
face,
with
very
bright
brown
eyes,
and
two
little
speckled,
dimpled
fists.

“You’ve
hurt
me!”
said
a
childish
voice
reproachfully.

“Have
I
though,”
the
man
answered
penitently,
“I
didn’t
go
for
to
do
it.”
As
he
spoke
he
unwrapped
the
grey
shawl
and
extricated
a
pretty
little
girl
of
about
five
years
of
age,
whose
dainty
shoes
and
smart
pink
frock
with
its
little
linen
apron
all
bespoke
a
mother’s
care.
The
child
was
pale
and
wan,
but
her
healthy
arms
and
legs
showed
that
she
had
suffered
less
than
her
companion.

“How
is
it
now?”
he
answered
anxiously,
for
she
was
still
rubbing
the
towsy
golden
curls
which
covered
the
back
of
her
head.

“Kiss
it
and
make
it
well,”
she
said,
with
perfect
gravity,
shoving
19
the
injured
part
up
to
him.
“That’s
what
mother
used
to
do.
Where’s
mother?”

“Mother’s
gone.
I
guess
you’ll
see
her
before
long.”

“Gone,
eh!”
said
the
little
girl.
“Funny,
she
didn’t
say
good-bye;
she
‘most
always
did
if
she
was
just
goin’
over
to
Auntie’s
for
tea,
and
now
she’s
been
away
three
days.
Say,
it’s
awful
dry,
ain’t
it?
Ain’t
there
no
water,
nor
nothing
to
eat?”

“No,
there
ain’t
nothing,
dearie.
You’ll
just
need
to
be
patient
awhile,
and
then
you’ll
be
all
right.
Put
your
head
up
agin
me
like
that,
and
then
you’ll
feel
bullier.
It
ain’t
easy
to
talk
when
your
lips
is
like
leather,
but
I
guess
I’d
best
let
you
know
how
the
cards
lie.
What’s
that
you’ve
got?”

“Pretty
things!
fine
things!”
cried
the
little
girl
enthusiastically,
holding
up
two
glittering
fragments
of
mica.
“When
we
goes
back
to
home
I’ll
give
them
to
brother
Bob.”

“You’ll
see
prettier
things
than
them
soon,”
said
the
man
confidently.
“You
just
wait
a
bit.
I
was
going
to
tell
you
though—you
remember
when
we
left
the
river?”

“Oh,
yes.”

“Well,
we
reckoned
we’d
strike
another
river
soon,
d’ye
see.
But
there
was
somethin’
wrong;
compasses,
or
map,
or
somethin’,
and
it
didn’t
turn
up.
Water
ran
out.
Just
except
a
little
drop
for
the
likes
of
you
and—and——”

“And
you
couldn’t
wash
yourself,”
interrupted
his
companion
gravely,
staring
up
at
his
grimy
visage.

“No,
nor
drink.
And
Mr.
Bender,
he
was
the
fust
to
go,
and
then
Indian
Pete,
and
then
Mrs.
McGregor,
and
then
Johnny
Hones,
and
then,
dearie,
your
mother.”

“Then
mother’s
a
deader
too,”
cried
the
little
girl
dropping
her
face
in
her
pinafore
and
sobbing
bitterly.

“Yes,
they
all
went
except
you
and
me.
Then
I
thought
there
was
some
chance
of
water
in
this
direction,
so
I
heaved
you
over
my
shoulder
and
we
tramped
it
together.
It
don’t
seem
as
though
we’ve
improved
matters.
There’s
an
almighty
small
chance
for
us
now!”

“Do
you
mean
that
we
are
going
to
die
too?”
asked
the
child,
checking
her
sobs,
and
raising
her
tear-stained
face.

“I
guess
that’s
about
the
size
of
it.”

“Why
didn’t
you
say
so
before?”
she
said,
laughing
gleefully.
“You
gave
me
such
a
fright.
Why,
of
course,
now
as
long
as
we
die
we’ll
be
with
mother
again.”

“Yes,
you
will,
dearie.”

“And
you
too.
I’ll
tell
her
how
awful
good
you’ve
been.
I’ll
bet
she
meets
us
at
the
door
of
Heaven
with
a
big
pitcher
of
water,
and
a
lot
of
buckwheat
cakes,
hot,
and
toasted
on
both
sides,
like
Bob
and
me
was
fond
of.
How
long
will
it
be
first?”

“I
don’t
know—not
very
long.”
The
man’s
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
northern
horizon.
In
the
blue
vault
of
the
heaven
there
had
appeared
three
little
specks
which
increased
in
size
every
moment,
so
rapidly
did
they
approach.
They
speedily
resolved
themselves
into
three
large
brown
birds,
which
circled
over
the
heads
of
the
two
wanderers,
and
then
settled
upon
some
rocks
which
overlooked
them.
They
were
buzzards,
the
vultures
of
the
west,
whose
coming
is
the
forerunner
of
death.

“Cocks
and
hens,”
cried
the
little
girl
gleefully,
pointing
at
their
ill-omened
forms,
and
clapping
her
hands
to
make
them
rise.
“Say,
did
God
make
this
country?”

“In
course
He
did,”
said
her
companion,
rather
startled
by
this
unexpected
question.

“He
made
the
country
down
in
Illinois,
and
He
made
the
Missouri,”
the
little
girl
continued.
“I
guess
somebody
else
made
the
country
in
these
parts.
It’s
not
nearly
so
well
done.
They
forgot
the
water
and
the
trees.”

“What
would
ye
think
of
offering
up
prayer?”
the
man
asked
diffidently.

“It
ain’t
night
yet,”
she
answered.

“It
don’t
matter.
It
ain’t
quite
regular,
but
He
won’t
mind
that,
you
bet.
You
say
over
them
ones
that
you
used
to
say
every
night
in
the
waggon
when
we
was
on
the
Plains.”

“Why
don’t
you
say
some
yourself?”
the
child
asked,
with
wondering
eyes.

“I
disremember
them,”
he
answered.
“I
hain’t
said
none
since
I
was
half
the
height
o’
that
gun.
I
guess
it’s
never
too
late.
You
say
them
out,
and
I’ll
stand
by
and
come
in
on
the
choruses.”

“Then
you’ll
need
to
kneel
down,
and
me
too,”
she
said,
laying
the
shawl
out
for
that
purpose.
“You’ve
got
to
put
your
hands
up
like
this.
It
makes
you
feel
kind
o’
good.”

It
was
a
strange
sight
had
there
been
anything
but
the
buzzards
to
see
it.
Side
by
side
on
the
narrow
shawl
knelt
the
two
wanderers,
the
little
prattling
child
and
the
reckless,
hardened
adventurer.
Her
chubby
face,
and
his
haggard,
angular
visage
were
both
turned
up
to
the
cloudless
heaven
in
heartfelt
entreaty
to
that
dread
being
with
whom
they
were
face
to
face,
while
the
two
voices—the
one
thin
and
clear,
the
other
deep
and
harsh—united
in
the
entreaty
for
mercy
and
forgiveness.
The
prayer
finished,
they
resumed
their
seat
in
the
shadow
of
the
boulder
until
the
child
fell
asleep,
nestling
upon
the
broad
breast
of
her
protector.
He
watched
over
her
slumber
for
some
time,
but
Nature
proved
to
be
too
strong
for
him.
For
three
days
and
three
nights
he
had
allowed
himself
neither
rest
nor
repose.
Slowly
the
eyelids
drooped
over
the
tired
eyes,
and
the
head
sunk
lower
and
lower
upon
the
breast,
until
the
man’s
grizzled
beard
was
mixed
with
the
gold
tresses
of
his
companion,
and
both
slept
the
same
deep
and
dreamless
slumber.

Had
the
wanderer
remained
awake
for
another
half
hour
a
strange
sight
would
have
met
his
eyes.
Far
away
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
alkali
plain
there
rose
up
a
little
spray
of
dust,
very
slight
at
first,
and
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
mists
of
the
distance,
but
gradually
growing
higher
and
broader
until
it
formed
a
solid,
well-defined
cloud.
This
cloud
continued
to
increase
in
size
until
it
became
evident
that
it
could
only
be
raised
by
a
great
multitude
of
moving
creatures.
In
more
fertile
spots
the
observer
would
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
one
of
those
great
herds
of
bisons
which
graze
upon
the
prairie
land
was
approaching
him.
This
was
obviously
impossible
in
these
arid
wilds.
As
the
whirl
of
dust
drew
nearer
to
the
solitary
bluff
upon
which
the
two
castaways
were
reposing,
the
canvas-covered
tilts
of
waggons
and
the
figures
of
armed
horsemen
began
to
show
up
through
the
haze,
and
the
apparition
revealed
itself
as
being
a
great
caravan
upon
its
journey
for
the
West.
But
what
a
caravan!
When
the
head
of
it
had
reached
the
base
of
the
mountains,
the
rear
was
not
yet
visible
on
the
horizon.
Right
across
the
enormous
plain
stretched
the
straggling
array,
waggons
and
carts,
men
on
horseback,
and
men
on
foot.
Innumerable
women
who
staggered
along
under
burdens,
and
children
who
toddled
beside
the
waggons
or
peeped
out
from
under
the
white
coverings.
This
was
evidently
no
ordinary
party
of
immigrants,
but
rather
some
nomad
people
who
had
been
compelled
from
stress
of
circumstances
to
seek
themselves
a
new
country.
There
rose
through
the
clear
air
a
confused
clattering
and
rumbling
from
this
great
mass
of
humanity,
with
the
creaking
of
wheels
and
the
neighing
of
horses.
Loud
as
it
was,
it
was
not
sufficient
to
rouse
the
two
tired
wayfarers
above
them.

At
the
head
of
the
column
there
rode
a
score
or
more
of
grave
ironfaced
men,
clad
in
sombre
homespun
garments
and
armed
with
rifles.
On
reaching
the
base
of
the
bluff
they
halted,
and
held
a
short
council
among
themselves.

“The
wells
are
to
the
right,
my
brothers,”
said
one,
a
hard-lipped,
clean-shaven
man
with
grizzly
hair.

“To
the
right
of
the
Sierra
Blanco—so
we
shall
reach
the
Rio
Grande,”
said
another.

“Fear
not
for
water,”
cried
a
third.
“He
who
could
draw
it
from
the
rocks
will
not
now
abandon
His
own
chosen
people.”

“Amen!
Amen!”
responded
the
whole
party.

They
were
about
to
resume
their
journey
when
one
of
the
youngest
and
keenest-eyed
uttered
an
exclamation
and
pointed
up
at
the
rugged
crag
above
them.
From
its
summit
there
fluttered
a
little
wisp
of
pink,
showing
up
hard
and
bright
against
the
grey
rocks
behind.
At
the
sight
there
was
a
general
reining
up
of
horses
and
unslinging
of
guns,
while
fresh
horsemen
came
galloping
up
to
reinforce
the
vanguard.
The
word
‘Redskins’
was
on
every
lip.

“There
can’t
be
any
number
of
Injuns
here,”
said
the
elderly
man
who
appeared
to
be
in
command.
“We
have
passed
the
Pawnees,
and
there
are
no
other
tribes
until
we
cross
the
great
mountains.”

“Shall
I
go
forward
and
see,
Brother
Stangerson,”
asked
one
of
the
band.

“And
I,”
“and
I,”
cried
a
dozen
voices.

“Leave
your
horses
below
and
we
will
await
you
here,”
the
Elder
answered.
In
a
moment
the
young
fellows
had
dismounted,
fastened
their
horses,
and
were
ascending
the
precipitous
slope
which
led
up
to
the
object
which
had
excited
their
curiosity.
They
advanced
rapidly
and
noiselessly,
with
the
confidence
and
dexterity
of
practised
scouts.
The
watchers
from
the
plain
below
could
see
them
flit
from
rock
to
rock
until
their
figures
stood
out
against
the
skyline.
The
young
man
who
had
first
given
the
alarm
was
leading
them.
Suddenly
his
followers
saw
him
throw
up
his
hands,
as
though
overcome
with
astonishment,
and
on
joining
him
they
were
affected
in
the
same
way
by
the
sight
which
met
their
eyes.

On
the
little
plateau
which
crowned
the
barren
hill
there
stood
a
single
giant
boulder,
and
against
this
boulder
there
lay
a
tall
man,
long-bearded
and
hard-featured,
but
of
an
excessive
thinness.
His
placid
face
and
regular
breathing
showed
that
he
was
fast
asleep.
Beside
him
lay
a
little
child,
with
her
round
white
arms
encircling
his
brown
sinewy
neck,
and
her
golden
haired
head
resting
upon
the
breast
of
his
velveteen
tunic.
Her
rosy
lips
were
parted,
showing
the
regular
line
of
snow-white
teeth
within,
and
a
playful
smile
played
over
her
infantile
features.
Her
plump
little
white
legs
terminating
in
white
socks
and
neat
shoes
with
shining
buckles,
offered
a
strange
contrast
to
the
long
shrivelled
members
of
her
companion.
On
the
ledge
of
rock
above
this
strange
couple
there
stood
three
solemn
buzzards,
who,
at
the
sight
of
the
new
comers
uttered
raucous
screams
of
disappointment
and
flapped
sullenly
away.

The
cries
of
the
foul
birds
awoke
the
two
sleepers
who
stared
about
20
them
in
bewilderment.
The
man
staggered
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
upon
the
plain
which
had
been
so
desolate
when
sleep
had
overtaken
him,
and
which
was
now
traversed
by
this
enormous
body
of
men
and
of
beasts.
His
face
assumed
an
expression
of
incredulity
as
he
gazed,
and
he
passed
his
boney
hand
over
his
eyes.
“This
is
what
they
call
delirium,
I
guess,”
he
muttered.
The
child
stood
beside
him,
holding
on
to
the
skirt
of
his
coat,
and
said
nothing
but
looked
all
round
her
with
the
wondering
questioning
gaze
of
childhood.

The
rescuing
party
were
speedily
able
to
convince
the
two
castaways
that
their
appearance
was
no
delusion.
One
of
them
seized
the
little
girl,
and
hoisted
her
upon
his
shoulder,
while
two
others
supported
her
gaunt
companion,
and
assisted
him
towards
the
waggons.

“My
name
is
John
Ferrier,”
the
wanderer
explained;
“me
and
that
little
un
are
all
that’s
left
o’
twenty-one
people.
The
rest
is
all
dead
o’
thirst
and
hunger
away
down
in
the
south.”

“Is
she
your
child?”
asked
someone.

“I
guess
she
is
now,”
the
other
cried,
defiantly;
“she’s
mine
‘cause
I
saved
her.
No
man
will
take
her
from
me.
She’s
Lucy
Ferrier
from
this
day
on.
Who
are
you,
though?”
he
continued,
glancing
with
curiosity
at
his
stalwart,
sunburned
rescuers;
“there
seems
to
be
a
powerful
lot
of
ye.”

“Nigh
upon
ten
thousand,”
said
one
of
the
young
men;
“we
are
the
persecuted
children
of
God—the
chosen
of
the
Angel
Merona.”

“I
never
heard
tell
on
him,”
said
the
wanderer.
“He
appears
to
have
chosen
a
fair
crowd
of
ye.”

“Do
not
jest
at
that
which
is
sacred,”
said
the
other
sternly.
“We
are
of
those
who
believe
in
those
sacred
writings,
drawn
in
Egyptian
letters
on
plates
of
beaten
gold,
which
were
handed
unto
the
holy
Joseph
Smith
at
Palmyra.
We
have
come
from
Nauvoo,
in
the
State
of
Illinois,
where
we
had
founded
our
temple.
We
have
come
to
seek
a
refuge
from
the
violent
man
and
from
the
godless,
even
though
it
be
the
heart
of
the
desert.”

The
name
of
Nauvoo
evidently
recalled
recollections
to
John
Ferrier.
“I
see,”
he
said,
“you
are
the
Mormons.”

“We
are
the
Mormons,”
answered
his
companions
with
one
voice.

“And
where
are
you
going?”

“We
do
not
know.
The
hand
of
God
is
leading
us
under
the
person
of
our
Prophet.
You
must
come
before
him.
He
shall
say
what
is
to
be
done
with
you.”

They
had
reached
the
base
of
the
hill
by
this
time,
and
were
surrounded
by
crowds
of
the
pilgrims—pale-faced
meek-looking
women,
strong
laughing
children,
and
anxious
earnest-eyed
men.
Many
were
the
cries
of
astonishment
and
of
commiseration
which
arose
from
them
when
they
perceived
the
youth
of
one
of
the
strangers
and
the
destitution
of
the
other.
Their
escort
did
not
halt,
however,
but
pushed
on,
followed
by
a
great
crowd
of
Mormons,
until
they
reached
a
waggon,
which
was
conspicuous
for
its
great
size
and
for
the
gaudiness
and
smartness
of
its
appearance.
Six
horses
were
yoked
to
it,
whereas
the
others
were
furnished
with
two,
or,
at
most,
four
a-piece.
Beside
the
driver
there
sat
a
man
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
thirty
years
of
age,
but
whose
massive
head
and
resolute
expression
marked
him
as
a
leader.
He
was
reading
a
brown-backed
volume,
but
as
the
crowd
approached
he
laid
it
aside,
and
listened
attentively
to
an
account
of
the
episode.
Then
he
turned
to
the
two
castaways.

“If
we
take
you
with
us,”
he
said,
in
solemn
words,
“it
can
only
be
as
believers
in
our
own
creed.
We
shall
have
no
wolves
in
our
fold.
Better
far
that
your
bones
should
bleach
in
this
wilderness
than
that
you
should
prove
to
be
that
little
speck
of
decay
which
in
time
corrupts
the
whole
fruit.
Will
you
come
with
us
on
these
terms?”

“Guess
I’ll
come
with
you
on
any
terms,”
said
Ferrier,
with
such
emphasis
that
the
grave
Elders
could
not
restrain
a
smile.
The
leader
alone
retained
his
stern,
impressive
expression.

“Take
him,
Brother
Stangerson,”
he
said,
“give
him
food
and
drink,
and
the
child
likewise.
Let
it
be
your
task
also
to
teach
him
our
holy
creed.
We
have
delayed
long
enough.
Forward!
On,
on
to
Zion!”

“On,
on
to
Zion!”
cried
the
crowd
of
Mormons,
and
the
words
rippled
down
the
long
caravan,
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
until
they
died
away
in
a
dull
murmur
in
the
far
distance.
With
a
cracking
of
whips
and
a
creaking
of
wheels
the
great
waggons
got
into
motion,
and
soon
the
whole
caravan
was
winding
along
once
more.
The
Elder
to
whose
care
the
two
waifs
had
been
committed,
led
them
to
his
waggon,
where
a
meal
was
already
awaiting
them.

“You
shall
remain
here,”
he
said.
“In
a
few
days
you
will
have
recovered
from
your
fatigues.
In
the
meantime,
remember
that
now
and
for
ever
you
are
of
our
religion.
Brigham
Young
has
said
it,
and
he
has
spoken
with
the
voice
of
Joseph
Smith,
which
is
the
voice
of
God.”





CHAPTER
II.
THE
FLOWER
OF
UTAH.

THIS
is
not
the
place
to
commemorate
the
trials
and
privations
endured
by
the
immigrant
Mormons
before
they
came
to
their
final
haven.
From
the
shores
of
the
Mississippi
to
the
western
slopes
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
they
had
struggled
on
with
a
constancy
almost
unparalleled
in
history.
The
savage
man,
and
the
savage
beast,
hunger,
thirst,
fatigue,
and
disease—every
impediment
which
Nature
could
place
in
the
way,
had
all
been
overcome
with
Anglo-Saxon
tenacity.
Yet
the
long
journey
and
the
accumulated
terrors
had
shaken
the
hearts
of
the
stoutest
among
them.
There
was
not
one
who
did
not
sink
upon
his
knees
in
heartfelt
prayer
when
they
saw
the
broad
valley
of
Utah
bathed
in
the
sunlight
beneath
them,
and
learned
from
the
lips
of
their
leader
that
this
was
the
promised
land,
and
that
these
virgin
acres
were
to
be
theirs
for
evermore.

Young
speedily
proved
himself
to
be
a
skilful
administrator
as
well
as
a
resolute
chief.
Maps
were
drawn
and
charts
prepared,
in
which
the
future
city
was
sketched
out.
All
around
farms
were
apportioned
and
allotted
in
proportion
to
the
standing
of
each
individual.
The
tradesman
was
put
to
his
trade
and
the
artisan
to
his
calling.
In
the
town
streets
and
squares
sprang
up,
as
if
by
magic.
In
the
country
there
was
draining
and
hedging,
planting
and
clearing,
until
the
next
summer
saw
the
whole
country
golden
with
the
wheat
crop.
Everything
prospered
in
the
strange
settlement.
Above
all,
the
great
temple
which
they
had
erected
in
the
centre
of
the
city
grew
ever
taller
and
larger.
From
the
first
blush
of
dawn
until
the
closing
of
the
twilight,
the
clatter
of
the
hammer
and
the
rasp
of
the
saw
was
never
absent
from
the
monument
which
the
immigrants
erected
to
Him
who
had
led
them
safe
through
many
dangers.

The
two
castaways,
John
Ferrier
and
the
little
girl
who
had
shared
his
fortunes
and
had
been
adopted
as
his
daughter,
accompanied
the
Mormons
to
the
end
of
their
great
pilgrimage.
Little
Lucy
Ferrier
was
borne
along
pleasantly
enough
in
Elder
Stangerson’s
waggon,
a
retreat
which
she
shared
with
the
Mormon’s
three
wives
and
with
his
son,
a
headstrong
forward
boy
of
twelve.
Having
rallied,
with
the
elasticity
of
childhood,
from
the
shock
caused
by
her
mother’s
death,
she
soon
became
a
pet
with
the
women,
and
reconciled
herself
to
this
new
life
in
her
moving
canvas-covered
home.
In
the
meantime
Ferrier
having
recovered
from
his
privations,
distinguished
himself
as
a
useful
guide
and
an
indefatigable
hunter.
So
rapidly
did
he
gain
the
esteem
of
his
new
companions,
that
when
they
reached
the
end
of
their
wanderings,
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
he
should
be
provided
with
as
large
and
as
fertile
a
tract
of
land
as
any
of
the
settlers,
with
the
exception
of
Young
himself,
and
of
Stangerson,
Kemball,
Johnston,
and
Drebber,
who
were
the
four
principal
Elders.

On
the
farm
thus
acquired
John
Ferrier
built
himself
a
substantial
log-house,
which
received
so
many
additions
in
succeeding
years
that
it
grew
into
a
roomy
villa.
He
was
a
man
of
a
practical
turn
of
mind,
keen
in
his
dealings
and
skilful
with
his
hands.
His
iron
constitution
enabled
him
to
work
morning
and
evening
at
improving
and
tilling
his
lands.
Hence
it
came
about
that
his
farm
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
prospered
exceedingly.
In
three
years
he
was
better
off
than
his
neighbours,
in
six
he
was
well-to-do,
in
nine
he
was
rich,
and
in
twelve
there
were
not
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
whole
of
Salt
Lake
City
who
could
compare
with
him.
From
the
great
inland
sea
to
the
distant
Wahsatch
Mountains
there
was
no
name
better
known
than
that
of
John
Ferrier.

There
was
one
way
and
only
one
in
which
he
offended
the
susceptibilities
of
his
co-religionists.
No
argument
or
persuasion
could
ever
induce
him
to
set
up
a
female
establishment
after
the
manner
of
his
companions.
He
never
gave
reasons
for
this
persistent
refusal,
but
contented
himself
by
resolutely
and
inflexibly
adhering
to
his
determination.
There
were
some
who
accused
him
of
lukewarmness
in
his
adopted
religion,
and
others
who
put
it
down
to
greed
of
wealth
and
reluctance
to
incur
expense.
Others,
again,
spoke
of
some
early
love
affair,
and
of
a
fair-haired
girl
who
had
pined
away
on
the
shores
of
the
Atlantic.
Whatever
the
reason,
Ferrier
remained
strictly
celibate.
In
every
other
respect
he
conformed
to
the
religion
of
the
young
settlement,
and
gained
the
name
of
being
an
orthodox
and
straight-walking
man.

Lucy
Ferrier
grew
up
within
the
log-house,
and
assisted
her
adopted
father
in
all
his
undertakings.
The
keen
air
of
the
mountains
and
the
balsamic
odour
of
the
pine
trees
took
the
place
of
nurse
and
mother
to
the
young
girl.
As
year
succeeded
to
year
she
grew
taller
and
stronger,
her
cheek
more
rudy,
and
her
step
more
elastic.
Many
a
wayfarer
upon
the
high
road
which
ran
by
Ferrier’s
farm
felt
long-forgotten
thoughts
revive
in
their
mind
as
they
watched
her
lithe
girlish
figure
tripping
through
the
wheatfields,
or
met
her
mounted
upon
her
father’s
mustang,
and
managing
it
with
all
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
true
child
of
the
West.
So
the
bud
blossomed
into
a
flower,
and
the
year
which
saw
her
father
the
richest
of
the
farmers
left
her
as
fair
a
specimen
of
American
girlhood
as
could
be
found
in
the
whole
Pacific
slope.

It
was
not
the
father,
however,
who
first
discovered
that
the
child
had
developed
into
the
woman.
It
seldom
is
in
such
cases.
That
mysterious
change
is
too
subtle
and
too
gradual
to
be
measured
by
dates.
Least
of
all
does
the
maiden
herself
know
it
until
the
tone
of
a
voice
or
the
touch
of
a
hand
sets
her
heart
thrilling
within
her,
and
she
learns,
with
a
mixture
of
pride
and
of
fear,
that
a
new
and
a
larger
nature
has
awoken
within
her.
There
are
few
who
cannot
recall
that
day
and
remember
the
one
little
incident
which
heralded
the
dawn
of
a
new
life.
In
the
case
of
Lucy
Ferrier
the
occasion
was
serious
enough
in
itself,
apart
from
its
future
influence
on
her
destiny
and
that
of
many
besides.

It
was
a
warm
June
morning,
and
the
Latter
Day
Saints
were
as
busy
as
the
bees
whose
hive
they
have
chosen
for
their
emblem.
In
the
fields
and
in
the
streets
rose
the
same
hum
of
human
industry.
Down
the
dusty
high
roads
defiled
long
streams
of
heavily-laden
mules,
all
heading
to
the
west,
for
the
gold
fever
had
broken
out
in
California,
and
the
Overland
Route
lay
through
the
City
of
the
Elect.
There,
too,
were
droves
of
sheep
and
bullocks
coming
in
from
the
outlying
pasture
lands,
and
trains
of
tired
immigrants,
men
and
horses
equally
weary
of
their
interminable
journey.
Through
all
this
motley
assemblage,
threading
her
way
with
the
skill
of
an
accomplished
rider,
there
galloped
Lucy
Ferrier,
her
fair
face
flushed
with
the
exercise
and
her
long
chestnut
hair
floating
out
behind
her.
She
had
a
commission
from
her
father
in
the
City,
and
was
dashing
in
as
she
had
done
many
a
time
before,
with
all
the
fearlessness
of
youth,
thinking
only
of
her
task
and
how
it
was
to
be
performed.
The
travel-stained
adventurers
gazed
after
her
in
astonishment,
and
even
the
unemotional
Indians,
journeying
in
with
their
pelties,
relaxed
their
accustomed
stoicism
as
they
marvelled
at
the
beauty
of
the
pale-faced
maiden.

She
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
city
when
she
found
the
road
blocked
by
a
great
drove
of
cattle,
driven
by
a
half-dozen
wild-looking
herdsmen
from
the
plains.
In
her
impatience
she
endeavoured
to
pass
this
obstacle
by
pushing
her
horse
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
gap.
Scarcely
had
she
got
fairly
into
it,
however,
before
the
beasts
closed
in
behind
her,
and
she
found
herself
completely
imbedded
in
the
moving
stream
of
fierce-eyed,
long-horned
bullocks.
Accustomed
as
she
was
to
deal
with
cattle,
she
was
not
alarmed
at
her
situation,
but
took
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
urge
her
horse
on
in
the
hopes
of
pushing
her
way
through
the
cavalcade.
Unfortunately
the
horns
of
one
of
the
creatures,
either
by
accident
or
design,
came
in
violent
contact
with
the
flank
of
the
mustang,
and
excited
it
to
madness.
In
an
instant
it
reared
up
upon
its
hind
legs
with
a
snort
of
rage,
and
pranced
and
tossed
in
a
way
that
would
have
unseated
any
but
a
most
skilful
rider.
The
situation
was
full
of
peril.
Every
plunge
of
the
excited
horse
brought
it
against
the
horns
again,
and
goaded
it
to
fresh
madness.
It
was
all
that
the
girl
could
do
to
keep
herself
in
the
saddle,
yet
a
slip
would
mean
a
terrible
death
under
the
hoofs
of
the
unwieldy
and
terrified
animals.
Unaccustomed
to
sudden
emergencies,
her
head
began
to
swim,
and
her
grip
upon
the
bridle
to
relax.
Choked
by
the
rising
cloud
of
dust
and
by
the
steam
from
the
struggling
creatures,
she
might
have
abandoned
her
efforts
in
despair,
but
for
a
kindly
voice
at
her
elbow
which
assured
her
of
assistance.
At
the
same
moment
a
sinewy
brown
hand
caught
the
frightened
horse
by
the
curb,
and
forcing
a
way
through
the
drove,
soon
brought
her
to
the
outskirts.

“You’re
not
hurt,
I
hope,
miss,”
said
her
preserver,
respectfully.

She
looked
up
at
his
dark,
fierce
face,
and
laughed
saucily.
“I’m
awful
frightened,”
she
said,
naively;
“whoever
would
have
thought
that
Poncho
would
have
been
so
scared
by
a
lot
of
cows?”

“Thank
God
you
kept
your
seat,”
the
other
said
earnestly.
He
was
a
tall,
savage-looking
young
fellow,
mounted
on
a
powerful
roan
horse,
and
clad
in
the
rough
dress
of
a
hunter,
with
a
long
rifle
slung
over
his
shoulders.
“I
guess
you
are
the
daughter
of
John
Ferrier,”
he
remarked,
“I
saw
you
ride
down
from
his
house.
When
you
see
him,
ask
him
if
he
remembers
the
Jefferson
Hopes
of
St.
Louis.
If
he’s
the
same
Ferrier,
my
father
and
he
were
pretty
thick.”

“Hadn’t
you
better
come
and
ask
yourself?”
she
asked,
demurely.

The
young
fellow
seemed
pleased
at
the
suggestion,
and
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure.
“I’ll
do
so,”
he
said,
“we’ve
been
in
the
mountains
for
two
months,
and
are
not
over
and
above
in
visiting
condition.
He
must
take
us
as
he
finds
us.”

“He
has
a
good
deal
to
thank
you
for,
and
so
have
I,”
she
answered,
“he’s
awful
fond
of
me.
If
those
cows
had
jumped
on
me
he’d
have
never
got
over
it.”

“Neither
would
I,”
said
her
companion.

“You!
Well,
I
don’t
see
that
it
would
make
much
matter
to
you,
anyhow.
You
ain’t
even
a
friend
of
ours.”

The
young
hunter’s
dark
face
grew
so
gloomy
over
this
remark
that
Lucy
Ferrier
laughed
aloud.

“There,
I
didn’t
mean
that,”
she
said;
“of
course,
you
are
a
friend
now.
You
must
come
and
see
us.
Now
I
must
push
along,
or
father
won’t
trust
me
with
his
business
any
more.
Good-bye!”

“Good-bye,”
he
answered,
raising
his
broad
sombrero,
and
bending
over
her
little
hand.
She
wheeled
her
mustang
round,
gave
it
a
cut
with
her
riding-whip,
and
darted
away
down
the
broad
road
in
a
rolling
cloud
of
dust.

Young
Jefferson
Hope
rode
on
with
his
companions,
gloomy
and
taciturn.
He
and
they
had
been
among
the
Nevada
Mountains
prospecting
for
silver,
and
were
returning
to
Salt
Lake
City
in
the
hope
of
raising
capital
enough
to
work
some
lodes
which
they
had
discovered.
He
had
been
as
keen
as
any
of
them
upon
the
business
until
this
sudden
incident
had
drawn
his
thoughts
into
another
channel.
The
sight
of
the
fair
young
girl,
as
frank
and
wholesome
as
the
Sierra
breezes,
had
stirred
his
volcanic,
untamed
heart
to
its
very
depths.
When
she
had
vanished
from
his
sight,
he
realized
that
a
crisis
had
come
in
his
life,
and
that
neither
silver
speculations
nor
any
other
questions
could
ever
be
of
such
importance
to
him
as
this
new
and
all-absorbing
one.
The
love
which
had
sprung
up
in
his
heart
was
not
the
sudden,
changeable
fancy
of
a
boy,
but
rather
the
wild,
fierce
passion
of
a
man
of
strong
will
and
imperious
temper.
He
had
been
accustomed
to
succeed
in
all
that
he
undertook.
He
swore
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
fail
in
this
if
human
effort
and
human
perseverance
could
render
him
successful.

He
called
on
John
Ferrier
that
night,
and
many
times
again,
until
his
face
was
a
familiar
one
at
the
farm-house.
John,
cooped
up
in
the
valley,
and
absorbed
in
his
work,
had
had
little
chance
of
learning
the
news
of
the
outside
world
during
the
last
twelve
years.
All
this
Jefferson
Hope
was
able
to
tell
him,
and
in
a
style
which
interested
Lucy
as
well
as
her
father.
He
had
been
a
pioneer
in
California,
and
could
narrate
many
a
strange
tale
of
fortunes
made
and
fortunes
lost
in
those
wild,
halcyon
days.
He
had
been
a
scout
too,
and
a
trapper,
a
silver
explorer,
and
a
ranchman.
Wherever
stirring
adventures
were
to
be
had,
Jefferson
Hope
had
been
there
in
search
of
them.
He
soon
became
a
favourite
with
the
old
farmer,
who
spoke
eloquently
of
his
virtues.
On
such
occasions,
Lucy
was
silent,
but
her
blushing
cheek
and
her
bright,
happy
eyes,
showed
only
too
clearly
that
her
young
heart
was
no
longer
her
own.
Her
honest
father
may
not
have
observed
these
symptoms,
but
they
were
assuredly
not
thrown
away
upon
the
man
who
had
won
her
affections.

It
was
a
summer
evening
when
he
came
galloping
down
the
road
and
pulled
up
at
the
gate.
She
was
at
the
doorway,
and
came
down
to
meet
him.
He
threw
the
bridle
over
the
fence
and
strode
up
the
pathway.

“I
am
off,
Lucy,”
he
said,
taking
her
two
hands
in
his,
and
gazing
tenderly
down
into
her
face;
“I
won’t
ask
you
to
come
with
me
now,
but
will
you
be
ready
to
come
when
I
am
here
again?”

“And
when
will
that
be?”
she
asked,
blushing
and
laughing.

“A
couple
of
months
at
the
outside.
I
will
come
and
claim
you
then,
my
darling.
There’s
no
one
who
can
stand
between
us.”

“And
how
about
father?”
she
asked.

“He
has
given
his
consent,
provided
we
get
these
mines
working
all
right.
I
have
no
fear
on
that
head.”

“Oh,
well;
of
course,
if
you
and
father
have
arranged
it
all,
there’s
no
more
to
be
said,”
she
whispered,
with
her
cheek
against
his
broad
breast.

“Thank
God!”
he
said,
hoarsely,
stooping
and
kissing
her.
“It
is
settled,
then.
The
longer
I
stay,
the
harder
it
will
be
to
go.
They
are
waiting
for
me
at
the
cañon.
Good-bye,
my
own
darling—good-bye.
In
two
months
you
shall
see
me.”

He
tore
himself
from
her
as
he
spoke,
and,
flinging
himself
upon
his
horse,
galloped
furiously
away,
never
even
looking
round,
as
though
afraid
that
his
resolution
might
fail
him
if
he
took
one
glance
at
what
he
was
leaving.
She
stood
at
the
gate,
gazing
after
him
until
he
vanished
from
her
sight.
Then
she
walked
back
into
the
house,
the
happiest
girl
in
all
Utah.





CHAPTER
III.
JOHN
FERRIER
TALKS
WITH
THE
PROPHET.

THREE
weeks
had
passed
since
Jefferson
Hope
and
his
comrades
had
departed
from
Salt
Lake
City.
John
Ferrier’s
heart
was
sore
within
him
when
he
thought
of
the
young
man’s
return,
and
of
the
impending
loss
of
his
adopted
child.
Yet
her
bright
and
happy
face
reconciled
him
to
the
arrangement
more
than
any
argument
could
have
done.
He
had
always
determined,
deep
down
in
his
resolute
heart,
that
nothing
would
ever
induce
him
to
allow
his
daughter
to
wed
a
Mormon.
Such
a
marriage
he
regarded
as
no
marriage
at
all,
but
as
a
shame
and
a
disgrace.
Whatever
he
might
think
of
the
Mormon
doctrines,
upon
that
one
point
he
was
inflexible.
He
had
to
seal
his
mouth
on
the
subject,
however,
for
to
express
an
unorthodox
opinion
was
a
dangerous
matter
in
those
days
in
the
Land
of
the
Saints.

Yes,
a
dangerous
matter—so
dangerous
that
even
the
most
saintly
dared
only
whisper
their
religious
opinions
with
bated
breath,
lest
something
which
fell
from
their
lips
might
be
misconstrued,
and
bring
down
a
swift
retribution
upon
them.
The
victims
of
persecution
had
now
turned
persecutors
on
their
own
account,
and
persecutors
of
the
most
terrible
description.
Not
the
Inquisition
of
Seville,
nor
the
German
Vehm-gericht,
nor
the
Secret
Societies
of
Italy,
were
ever
able
to
put
a
more
formidable
machinery
in
motion
than
that
which
cast
a
cloud
over
the
State
of
Utah.

Its
invisibility,
and
the
mystery
which
was
attached
to
it,
made
this
organization
doubly
terrible.
It
appeared
to
be
omniscient
and
omnipotent,
and
yet
was
neither
seen
nor
heard.
The
man
who
held
out
against
the
Church
vanished
away,
and
none
knew
whither
he
had
gone
or
what
had
befallen
him.
His
wife
and
his
children
awaited
him
at
home,
but
no
father
ever
returned
to
tell
them
how
he
had
fared
at
the
hands
of
his
secret
judges.
A
rash
word
or
a
hasty
act
was
followed
by
annihilation,
and
yet
none
knew
what
the
nature
might
be
of
this
terrible
power
which
was
suspended
over
them.
No
wonder
that
men
went
about
in
fear
and
trembling,
and
that
even
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
they
dared
not
whisper
the
doubts
which
oppressed
them.

At
first
this
vague
and
terrible
power
was
exercised
only
upon
the
recalcitrants
who,
having
embraced
the
Mormon
faith,
wished
afterwards
to
pervert
or
to
abandon
it.
Soon,
however,
it
took
a
wider
range.
The
supply
of
adult
women
was
running
short,
and
polygamy
without
a
female
population
on
which
to
draw
was
a
barren
doctrine
indeed.
Strange
rumours
began
to
be
bandied
about—rumours
of
murdered
immigrants
and
rifled
camps
in
regions
where
Indians
had
never
been
seen.
Fresh
women
appeared
in
the
harems
of
the
Elders—women
who
pined
and
wept,
and
bore
upon
their
faces
the
traces
of
an
unextinguishable
horror.
Belated
wanderers
upon
the
mountains
spoke
of
gangs
of
armed
men,
masked,
stealthy,
and
noiseless,
who
flitted
by
them
in
the
darkness.
These
tales
and
rumours
took
substance
and
shape,
and
were
corroborated
and
re-corroborated,
until
they
resolved
themselves
into
a
definite
name.
To
this
day,
in
the
lonely
ranches
of
the
West,
the
name
of
the
Danite
Band,
or
the
Avenging
Angels,
is
a
sinister
and
an
ill-omened
one.

Fuller
knowledge
of
the
organization
which
produced
such
terrible
results
served
to
increase
rather
than
to
lessen
the
horror
which
it
inspired
in
the
minds
of
men.
None
knew
who
belonged
to
this
ruthless
society.
The
names
of
the
participators
in
the
deeds
of
blood
and
violence
done
under
the
name
of
religion
were
kept
profoundly
secret.
The
very
friend
to
whom
you
communicated
your
misgivings
as
to
the
Prophet
and
his
mission,
might
be
one
of
those
who
would
come
forth
at
night
with
fire
and
sword
to
exact
a
terrible
reparation.
Hence
every
man
feared
his
neighbour,
and
none
spoke
of
the
things
which
were
nearest
his
heart.

One
fine
morning,
John
Ferrier
was
about
to
set
out
to
his
wheatfields,
when
he
heard
the
click
of
the
latch,
and,
looking
through
the
window,
saw
a
stout,
sandy-haired,
middle-aged
man
coming
up
the
pathway.
His
heart
leapt
to
his
mouth,
for
this
was
none
other
than
the
great
Brigham
Young
himself.
Full
of
trepidation—for
he
knew
that
such
a
visit
boded
him
little
good—Ferrier
ran
to
the
door
to
greet
the
Mormon
chief.
The
latter,
however,
received
his
salutations
coldly,
and
followed
him
with
a
stern
face
into
the
sitting-room.

“Brother
Ferrier,”
he
said,
taking
a
seat,
and
eyeing
the
farmer
keenly
from
under
his
light-coloured
eyelashes,
“the
true
believers
have
been
good
friends
to
you.
We
picked
you
up
when
you
were
starving
in
the
desert,
we
shared
our
food
with
you,
led
you
safe
to
the
Chosen
Valley,
gave
you
a
goodly
share
of
land,
and
allowed
you
to
wax
rich
under
our
protection.
Is
not
this
so?”

“It
is
so,”
answered
John
Ferrier.

“In
return
for
all
this
we
asked
but
one
condition:
that
was,
that
you
should
embrace
the
true
faith,
and
conform
in
every
way
to
its
usages.
This
you
promised
to
do,
and
this,
if
common
report
says
truly,
you
have
neglected.”

“And
how
have
I
neglected
it?”
asked
Ferrier,
throwing
out
his
hands
in
expostulation.
“Have
I
not
given
to
the
common
fund?
Have
I
not
attended
at
the
Temple?
Have
I
not——?”

“Where
are
your
wives?”
asked
Young,
looking
round
him.
“Call
them
in,
that
I
may
greet
them.”

“It
is
true
that
I
have
not
married,”
Ferrier
answered.
“But
women
were
few,
and
there
were
many
who
had
better
claims
than
I.
I
was
not
a
lonely
man:
I
had
my
daughter
to
attend
to
my
wants.”

“It
is
of
that
daughter
that
I
would
speak
to
you,”
said
the
leader
of
the
Mormons.
“She
has
grown
to
be
the
flower
of
Utah,
and
has
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
many
who
are
high
in
the
land.”

John
Ferrier
groaned
internally.

“There
are
stories
of
her
which
I
would
fain
disbelieve—stories
that
she
is
sealed
to
some
Gentile.
This
must
be
the
gossip
of
idle
tongues.
What
is
the
thirteenth
rule
in
the
code
of
the
sainted
Joseph
Smith?
‘Let
every
maiden
of
the
true
faith
marry
one
of
the
elect;
for
if
she
wed
a
Gentile,
she
commits
a
grievous
sin.’
This
being
so,
it
is
impossible
that
you,
who
profess
the
holy
creed,
should
suffer
your
daughter
to
violate
it.”

John
Ferrier
made
no
answer,
but
he
played
nervously
with
his
riding-whip.

“Upon
this
one
point
your
whole
faith
shall
be
tested—so
it
has
been
decided
in
the
Sacred
Council
of
Four.
The
girl
is
young,
and
we
would
not
have
her
wed
grey
hairs,
neither
would
we
deprive
her
of
all
choice.
We
Elders
have
many
heifers,
29
but
our
children
must
also
be
provided.
Stangerson
has
a
son,
and
Drebber
has
a
son,
and
either
of
them
would
gladly
welcome
your
daughter
to
their
house.
Let
her
choose
between
them.
They
are
young
and
rich,
and
of
the
true
faith.
What
say
you
to
that?”

Ferrier
remained
silent
for
some
little
time
with
his
brows
knitted.

“You
will
give
us
time,”
he
said
at
last.
“My
daughter
is
very
young—she
is
scarce
of
an
age
to
marry.”

“She
shall
have
a
month
to
choose,”
said
Young,
rising
from
his
seat.
“At
the
end
of
that
time
she
shall
give
her
answer.”

He
was
passing
through
the
door,
when
he
turned,
with
flushed
face
and
flashing
eyes.
“It
were
better
for
you,
John
Ferrier,”
he
thundered,
“that
you
and
she
were
now
lying
blanched
skeletons
upon
the
Sierra
Blanco,
than
that
you
should
put
your
weak
wills
against
the
orders
of
the
Holy
Four!”

With
a
threatening
gesture
of
his
hand,
he
turned
from
the
door,
and
Ferrier
heard
his
heavy
step
scrunching
along
the
shingly
path.

He
was
still
sitting
with
his
elbows
upon
his
knees,
considering
how
he
should
broach
the
matter
to
his
daughter
when
a
soft
hand
was
laid
upon
his,
and
looking
up,
he
saw
her
standing
beside
him.
One
glance
at
her
pale,
frightened
face
showed
him
that
she
had
heard
what
had
passed.

“I
could
not
help
it,”
she
said,
in
answer
to
his
look.
“His
voice
rang
through
the
house.
Oh,
father,
father,
what
shall
we
do?”

“Don’t
you
scare
yourself,”
he
answered,
drawing
her
to
him,
and
passing
his
broad,
rough
hand
caressingly
over
her
chestnut
hair.
“We’ll
fix
it
up
somehow
or
another.
You
don’t
find
your
fancy
kind
o’
lessening
for
this
chap,
do
you?”

A
sob
and
a
squeeze
of
his
hand
was
her
only
answer.

“No;
of
course
not.
I
shouldn’t
care
to
hear
you
say
you
did.
He’s
a
likely
lad,
and
he’s
a
Christian,
which
is
more
than
these
folk
here,
in
spite
o’
all
their
praying
and
preaching.
There’s
a
party
starting
for
Nevada
to-morrow,
and
I’ll
manage
to
send
him
a
message
letting
him
know
the
hole
we
are
in.
If
I
know
anything
o’
that
young
man,
he’ll
be
back
here
with
a
speed
that
would
whip
electro-telegraphs.”

Lucy
laughed
through
her
tears
at
her
father’s
description.

“When
he
comes,
he
will
advise
us
for
the
best.
But
it
is
for
you
that
I
am
frightened,
dear.
One
hears—one
hears
such
dreadful
stories
about
those
who
oppose
the
Prophet:
something
terrible
always
happens
to
them.”

“But
we
haven’t
opposed
him
yet,”
her
father
answered.
“It
will
be
time
to
look
out
for
squalls
when
we
do.
We
have
a
clear
month
before
us;
at
the
end
of
that,
I
guess
we
had
best
shin
out
of
Utah.”

“Leave
Utah!”

“That’s
about
the
size
of
it.”

“But
the
farm?”

“We
will
raise
as
much
as
we
can
in
money,
and
let
the
rest
go.
To
tell
the
truth,
Lucy,
it
isn’t
the
first
time
I
have
thought
of
doing
it.
I
don’t
care
about
knuckling
under
to
any
man,
as
these
folk
do
to
their
darned
prophet.
I’m
a
free-born
American,
and
it’s
all
new
to
me.
Guess
I’m
too
old
to
learn.
If
he
comes
browsing
about
this
farm,
he
might
chance
to
run
up
against
a
charge
of
buckshot
travelling
in
the
opposite
direction.”

“But
they
won’t
let
us
leave,”
his
daughter
objected.

“Wait
till
Jefferson
comes,
and
we’ll
soon
manage
that.
In
the
meantime,
don’t
you
fret
yourself,
my
dearie,
and
don’t
get
your
eyes
swelled
up,
else
he’ll
be
walking
into
me
when
he
sees
you.
There’s
nothing
to
be
afeared
about,
and
there’s
no
danger
at
all.”

John
Ferrier
uttered
these
consoling
remarks
in
a
very
confident
tone,
but
she
could
not
help
observing
that
he
paid
unusual
care
to
the
fastening
of
the
doors
that
night,
and
that
he
carefully
cleaned
and
loaded
the
rusty
old
shotgun
which
hung
upon
the
wall
of
his
bedroom.





CHAPTER
IV.
A
FLIGHT
FOR
LIFE.

ON
the
morning
which
followed
his
interview
with
the
Mormon
Prophet,
John
Ferrier
went
in
to
Salt
Lake
City,
and
having
found
his
acquaintance,
who
was
bound
for
the
Nevada
Mountains,
he
entrusted
him
with
his
message
to
Jefferson
Hope.
In
it
he
told
the
young
man
of
the
imminent
danger
which
threatened
them,
and
how
necessary
it
was
that
he
should
return.
Having
done
thus
he
felt
easier
in
his
mind,
and
returned
home
with
a
lighter
heart.

As
he
approached
his
farm,
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
horse
hitched
to
each
of
the
posts
of
the
gate.
Still
more
surprised
was
he
on
entering
to
find
two
young
men
in
possession
of
his
sitting-room.
One,
with
a
long
pale
face,
was
leaning
back
in
the
rocking-chair,
with
his
feet
cocked
up
upon
the
stove.
The
other,
a
bull-necked
youth
with
coarse
bloated
features,
was
standing
in
front
of
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket,
whistling
a
popular
hymn.
Both
of
them
nodded
to
Ferrier
as
he
entered,
and
the
one
in
the
rocking-chair
commenced
the
conversation.

“Maybe
you
don’t
know
us,”
he
said.
“This
here
is
the
son
of
Elder
Drebber,
and
I’m
Joseph
Stangerson,
who
travelled
with
you
in
the
desert
when
the
Lord
stretched
out
His
hand
and
gathered
you
into
the
true
fold.”

“As
He
will
all
the
nations
in
His
own
good
time,”
said
the
other
in
a
nasal
voice;
“He
grindeth
slowly
but
exceeding
small.”

John
Ferrier
bowed
coldly.
He
had
guessed
who
his
visitors
were.

“We
have
come,”
continued
Stangerson,
“at
the
advice
of
our
fathers
to
solicit
the
hand
of
your
daughter
for
whichever
of
us
may
seem
good
to
you
and
to
her.
As
I
have
but
four
wives
and
Brother
Drebber
here
has
seven,
it
appears
to
me
that
my
claim
is
the
stronger
one.”

“Nay,
nay,
Brother
Stangerson,”
cried
the
other;
“the
question
is
not
how
many
wives
we
have,
but
how
many
we
can
keep.
My
father
has
now
given
over
his
mills
to
me,
and
I
am
the
richer
man.”

“But
my
prospects
are
better,”
said
the
other,
warmly.
“When
the
Lord
removes
my
father,
I
shall
have
his
tanning
yard
and
his
leather
factory.
Then
I
am
your
elder,
and
am
higher
in
the
Church.”

“It
will
be
for
the
maiden
to
decide,”
rejoined
young
Drebber,
smirking
at
his
own
reflection
in
the
glass.
“We
will
leave
it
all
to
her
decision.”

During
this
dialogue,
John
Ferrier
had
stood
fuming
in
the
doorway,
hardly
able
to
keep
his
riding-whip
from
the
backs
of
his
two
visitors.

“Look
here,”
he
said
at
last,
striding
up
to
them,
“when
my
daughter
summons
you,
you
can
come,
but
until
then
I
don’t
want
to
see
your
faces
again.”

The
two
young
Mormons
stared
at
him
in
amazement.
In
their
eyes
this
competition
between
them
for
the
maiden’s
hand
was
the
highest
of
honours
both
to
her
and
her
father.

“There
are
two
ways
out
of
the
room,”
cried
Ferrier;
“there
is
the
door,
and
there
is
the
window.
Which
do
you
care
to
use?”

His
brown
face
looked
so
savage,
and
his
gaunt
hands
so
threatening,
that
his
visitors
sprang
to
their
feet
and
beat
a
hurried
retreat.
The
old
farmer
followed
them
to
the
door.

“Let
me
know
when
you
have
settled
which
it
is
to
be,”
he
said,
sardonically.

“You
shall
smart
for
this!”
Stangerson
cried,
white
with
rage.
“You
have
defied
the
Prophet
and
the
Council
of
Four.
You
shall
rue
it
to
the
end
of
your
days.”

“The
hand
of
the
Lord
shall
be
heavy
upon
you,”
cried
young
Drebber;
“He
will
arise
and
smite
you!”

“Then
I’ll
start
the
smiting,”
exclaimed
Ferrier
furiously,
and
would
have
rushed
upstairs
for
his
gun
had
not
Lucy
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
restrained
him.
Before
he
could
escape
from
her,
the
clatter
of
horses’
hoofs
told
him
that
they
were
beyond
his
reach.

“The
young
canting
rascals!”
he
exclaimed,
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead;
“I
would
sooner
see
you
in
your
grave,
my
girl,
than
the
wife
of
either
of
them.”

“And
so
should
I,
father,”
she
answered,
with
spirit;
“but
Jefferson
will
soon
be
here.”

“Yes.
It
will
not
be
long
before
he
comes.
The
sooner
the
better,
for
we
do
not
know
what
their
next
move
may
be.”

It
was,
indeed,
high
time
that
someone
capable
of
giving
advice
and
help
should
come
to
the
aid
of
the
sturdy
old
farmer
and
his
adopted
daughter.
In
the
whole
history
of
the
settlement
there
had
never
been
such
a
case
of
rank
disobedience
to
the
authority
of
the
Elders.
If
minor
errors
were
punished
so
sternly,
what
would
be
the
fate
of
this
arch
rebel.
Ferrier
knew
that
his
wealth
and
position
would
be
of
no
avail
to
him.
Others
as
well
known
and
as
rich
as
himself
had
been
spirited
away
before
now,
and
their
goods
given
over
to
the
Church.
He
was
a
brave
man,
but
he
trembled
at
the
vague,
shadowy
terrors
which
hung
over
him.
Any
known
danger
he
could
face
with
a
firm
lip,
but
this
suspense
was
unnerving.
He
concealed
his
fears
from
his
daughter,
however,
and
affected
to
make
light
of
the
whole
matter,
though
she,
with
the
keen
eye
of
love,
saw
plainly
that
he
was
ill
at
ease.

He
expected
that
he
would
receive
some
message
or
remonstrance
from
Young
as
to
his
conduct,
and
he
was
not
mistaken,
though
it
came
in
an
unlooked-for
manner.
Upon
rising
next
morning
he
found,
to
his
surprise,
a
small
square
of
paper
pinned
on
to
the
coverlet
of
his
bed
just
over
his
chest.
On
it
was
printed,
in
bold
straggling
letters:—

“Twenty-nine
days
are
given
you
for
amendment,
and
then——”

The
dash
was
more
fear-inspiring
than
any
threat
could
have
been.
How
this
warning
came
into
his
room
puzzled
John
Ferrier
sorely,
for
his
servants
slept
in
an
outhouse,
and
the
doors
and
windows
had
all
been
secured.
He
crumpled
the
paper
up
and
said
nothing
to
his
daughter,
but
the
incident
struck
a
chill
into
his
heart.
The
twenty-nine
days
were
evidently
the
balance
of
the
month
which
Young
had
promised.
What
strength
or
courage
could
avail
against
an
enemy
armed
with
such
mysterious
powers?
The
hand
which
fastened
that
pin
might
have
struck
him
to
the
heart,
and
he
could
never
have
known
who
had
slain
him.

Still
more
shaken
was
he
next
morning.
They
had
sat
down
to
their
breakfast
when
Lucy
with
a
cry
of
surprise
pointed
upwards.
In
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
was
scrawled,
with
a
burned
stick
apparently,
the
number
28.
To
his
daughter
it
was
unintelligible,
and
he
did
not
enlighten
her.
That
night
he
sat
up
with
his
gun
and
kept
watch
and
ward.
He
saw
and
he
heard
nothing,
and
yet
in
the
morning
a
great
27
had
been
painted
upon
the
outside
of
his
door.

Thus
day
followed
day;
and
as
sure
as
morning
came
he
found
that
his
unseen
enemies
had
kept
their
register,
and
had
marked
up
in
some
conspicuous
position
how
many
days
were
still
left
to
him
out
of
the
month
of
grace.
Sometimes
the
fatal
numbers
appeared
upon
the
walls,
sometimes
upon
the
floors,
occasionally
they
were
on
small
placards
stuck
upon
the
garden
gate
or
the
railings.
With
all
his
vigilance
John
Ferrier
could
not
discover
whence
these
daily
warnings
proceeded.
A
horror
which
was
almost
superstitious
came
upon
him
at
the
sight
of
them.
He
became
haggard
and
restless,
and
his
eyes
had
the
troubled
look
of
some
hunted
creature.
He
had
but
one
hope
in
life
now,
and
that
was
for
the
arrival
of
the
young
hunter
from
Nevada.

Twenty
had
changed
to
fifteen
and
fifteen
to
ten,
but
there
was
no
news
of
the
absentee.
One
by
one
the
numbers
dwindled
down,
and
still
there
came
no
sign
of
him.
Whenever
a
horseman
clattered
down
the
road,
or
a
driver
shouted
at
his
team,
the
old
farmer
hurried
to
the
gate
thinking
that
help
had
arrived
at
last.
At
last,
when
he
saw
five
give
way
to
four
and
that
again
to
three,
he
lost
heart,
and
abandoned
all
hope
of
escape.
Single-handed,
and
with
his
limited
knowledge
of
the
mountains
which
surrounded
the
settlement,
he
knew
that
he
was
powerless.
The
more-frequented
roads
were
strictly
watched
and
guarded,
and
none
could
pass
along
them
without
an
order
from
the
Council.
Turn
which
way
he
would,
there
appeared
to
be
no
avoiding
the
blow
which
hung
over
him.
Yet
the
old
man
never
wavered
in
his
resolution
to
part
with
life
itself
before
he
consented
to
what
he
regarded
as
his
daughter’s
dishonour.

He
was
sitting
alone
one
evening
pondering
deeply
over
his
troubles,
and
searching
vainly
for
some
way
out
of
them.
That
morning
had
shown
the
figure
2
upon
the
wall
of
his
house,
and
the
next
day
would
be
the
last
of
the
allotted
time.
What
was
to
happen
then?
All
manner
of
vague
and
terrible
fancies
filled
his
imagination.
And
his
daughter—what
was
to
become
of
her
after
he
was
gone?
Was
there
no
escape
from
the
invisible
network
which
was
drawn
all
round
them.
He
sank
his
head
upon
the
table
and
sobbed
at
the
thought
of
his
own
impotence.

What
was
that?
In
the
silence
he
heard
a
gentle
scratching
sound—low,
but
very
distinct
in
the
quiet
of
the
night.
It
came
from
the
door
of
the
house.
Ferrier
crept
into
the
hall
and
listened
intently.
There
was
a
pause
for
a
few
moments,
and
then
the
low
insidious
sound
was
repeated.
Someone
was
evidently
tapping
very
gently
upon
one
of
the
panels
of
the
door.
Was
it
some
midnight
assassin
who
had
come
to
carry
out
the
murderous
orders
of
the
secret
tribunal?
Or
was
it
some
agent
who
was
marking
up
that
the
last
day
of
grace
had
arrived.
John
Ferrier
felt
that
instant
death
would
be
better
than
the
suspense
which
shook
his
nerves
and
chilled
his
heart.
Springing
forward
he
drew
the
bolt
and
threw
the
door
open.

Outside
all
was
calm
and
quiet.
The
night
was
fine,
and
the
stars
were
twinkling
brightly
overhead.
The
little
front
garden
lay
before
the
farmer’s
eyes
bounded
by
the
fence
and
gate,
but
neither
there
nor
on
the
road
was
any
human
being
to
be
seen.
With
a
sigh
of
relief,
Ferrier
looked
to
right
and
to
left,
until
happening
to
glance
straight
down
at
his
own
feet
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
a
man
lying
flat
upon
his
face
upon
the
ground,
with
arms
and
legs
all
asprawl.

So
unnerved
was
he
at
the
sight
that
he
leaned
up
against
the
wall
with
his
hand
to
his
throat
to
stifle
his
inclination
to
call
out.
His
first
thought
was
that
the
prostrate
figure
was
that
of
some
wounded
or
dying
man,
but
as
he
watched
it
he
saw
it
writhe
along
the
ground
and
into
the
hall
with
the
rapidity
and
noiselessness
of
a
serpent.
Once
within
the
house
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet,
closed
the
door,
and
revealed
to
the
astonished
farmer
the
fierce
face
and
resolute
expression
of
Jefferson
Hope.

“Good
God!”
gasped
John
Ferrier.
“How
you
scared
me!
Whatever
made
you
come
in
like
that.”

“Give
me
food,”
the
other
said,
hoarsely.
“I
have
had
no
time
for
bite
or
sup
for
eight-and-forty
hours.”
He
flung
himself
upon
the
21
cold
meat
and
bread
which
were
still
lying
upon
the
table
from
his
host’s
supper,
and
devoured
it
voraciously.
“Does
Lucy
bear
up
well?”
he
asked,
when
he
had
satisfied
his
hunger.

“Yes.
She
does
not
know
the
danger,”
her
father
answered.

“That
is
well.
The
house
is
watched
on
every
side.
That
is
why
I
crawled
my
way
up
to
it.
They
may
be
darned
sharp,
but
they’re
not
quite
sharp
enough
to
catch
a
Washoe
hunter.”

John
Ferrier
felt
a
different
man
now
that
he
realized
that
he
had
a
devoted
ally.
He
seized
the
young
man’s
leathery
hand
and
wrung
it
cordially.
“You’re
a
man
to
be
proud
of,”
he
said.
“There
are
not
many
who
would
come
to
share
our
danger
and
our
troubles.”

“You’ve
hit
it
there,
pard,”
the
young
hunter
answered.
“I
have
a
respect
for
you,
but
if
you
were
alone
in
this
business
I’d
think
twice
before
I
put
my
head
into
such
a
hornet’s
nest.
It’s
Lucy
that
brings
me
here,
and
before
harm
comes
on
her
I
guess
there
will
be
one
less
o’
the
Hope
family
in
Utah.”

“What
are
we
to
do?”

“To-morrow
is
your
last
day,
and
unless
you
act
to-night
you
are
lost.
I
have
a
mule
and
two
horses
waiting
in
the
Eagle
Ravine.
How
much
money
have
you?”

“Two
thousand
dollars
in
gold,
and
five
in
notes.”

“That
will
do.
I
have
as
much
more
to
add
to
it.
We
must
push
for
Carson
City
through
the
mountains.
You
had
best
wake
Lucy.
It
is
as
well
that
the
servants
do
not
sleep
in
the
house.”

While
Ferrier
was
absent,
preparing
his
daughter
for
the
approaching
journey,
Jefferson
Hope
packed
all
the
eatables
that
he
could
find
into
a
small
parcel,
and
filled
a
stoneware
jar
with
water,
for
he
knew
by
experience
that
the
mountain
wells
were
few
and
far
between.
He
had
hardly
completed
his
arrangements
before
the
farmer
returned
with
his
daughter
all
dressed
and
ready
for
a
start.
The
greeting
between
the
lovers
was
warm,
but
brief,
for
minutes
were
precious,
and
there
was
much
to
be
done.

“We
must
make
our
start
at
once,”
said
Jefferson
Hope,
speaking
in
a
low
but
resolute
voice,
like
one
who
realizes
the
greatness
of
the
peril,
but
has
steeled
his
heart
to
meet
it.
“The
front
and
back
entrances
are
watched,
but
with
caution
we
may
get
away
through
the
side
window
and
across
the
fields.
Once
on
the
road
we
are
only
two
miles
from
the
Ravine
where
the
horses
are
waiting.
By
daybreak
we
should
be
half-way
through
the
mountains.”

“What
if
we
are
stopped,”
asked
Ferrier.

Hope
slapped
the
revolver
butt
which
protruded
from
the
front
of
his
tunic.
“If
they
are
too
many
for
us
we
shall
take
two
or
three
of
them
with
us,”
he
said
with
a
sinister
smile.

The
lights
inside
the
house
had
all
been
extinguished,
and
from
the
darkened
window
Ferrier
peered
over
the
fields
which
had
been
his
own,
and
which
he
was
now
about
to
abandon
for
ever.
He
had
long
nerved
himself
to
the
sacrifice,
however,
and
the
thought
of
the
honour
and
happiness
of
his
daughter
outweighed
any
regret
at
his
ruined
fortunes.
All
looked
so
peaceful
and
happy,
the
rustling
trees
and
the
broad
silent
stretch
of
grain-land,
that
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
the
spirit
of
murder
lurked
through
it
all.
Yet
the
white
face
and
set
expression
of
the
young
hunter
showed
that
in
his
approach
to
the
house
he
had
seen
enough
to
satisfy
him
upon
that
head.

Ferrier
carried
the
bag
of
gold
and
notes,
Jefferson
Hope
had
the
scanty
provisions
and
water,
while
Lucy
had
a
small
bundle
containing
a
few
of
her
more
valued
possessions.
Opening
the
window
very
slowly
and
carefully,
they
waited
until
a
dark
cloud
had
somewhat
obscured
the
night,
and
then
one
by
one
passed
through
into
the
little
garden.
With
bated
breath
and
crouching
figures
they
stumbled
across
it,
and
gained
the
shelter
of
the
hedge,
which
they
skirted
until
they
came
to
the
gap
which
opened
into
the
cornfields.
They
had
just
reached
this
point
when
the
young
man
seized
his
two
companions
and
dragged
them
down
into
the
shadow,
where
they
lay
silent
and
trembling.

It
was
as
well
that
his
prairie
training
had
given
Jefferson
Hope
the
ears
of
a
lynx.
He
and
his
friends
had
hardly
crouched
down
before
the
melancholy
hooting
of
a
mountain
owl
was
heard
within
a
few
yards
of
them,
which
was
immediately
answered
by
another
hoot
at
a
small
distance.
At
the
same
moment
a
vague
shadowy
figure
emerged
from
the
gap
for
which
they
had
been
making,
and
uttered
the
plaintive
signal
cry
again,
on
which
a
second
man
appeared
out
of
the
obscurity.

“To-morrow
at
midnight,”
said
the
first
who
appeared
to
be
in
authority.
“When
the
Whip-poor-Will
calls
three
times.”

“It
is
well,”
returned
the
other.
“Shall
I
tell
Brother
Drebber?”

“Pass
it
on
to
him,
and
from
him
to
the
others.
Nine
to
seven!”

“Seven
to
five!”
repeated
the
other,
and
the
two
figures
flitted
away
in
different
directions.
Their
concluding
words
had
evidently
been
some
form
of
sign
and
countersign.
The
instant
that
their
footsteps
had
died
away
in
the
distance,
Jefferson
Hope
sprang
to
his
feet,
and
helping
his
companions
through
the
gap,
led
the
way
across
the
fields
at
the
top
of
his
speed,
supporting
and
half-carrying
the
girl
when
her
strength
appeared
to
fail
her.

“Hurry
on!
hurry
on!”
he
gasped
from
time
to
time.
“We
are
through
the
line
of
sentinels.
Everything
depends
on
speed.
Hurry
on!”

Once
on
the
high
road
they
made
rapid
progress.
Only
once
did
they
meet
anyone,
and
then
they
managed
to
slip
into
a
field,
and
so
avoid
recognition.
Before
reaching
the
town
the
hunter
branched
away
into
a
rugged
and
narrow
footpath
which
led
to
the
mountains.
Two
dark
jagged
peaks
loomed
above
them
through
the
darkness,
and
the
defile
which
led
between
them
was
the
Eagle
Cañon
in
which
the
horses
were
awaiting
them.
With
unerring
instinct
Jefferson
Hope
picked
his
way
among
the
great
boulders
and
along
the
bed
of
a
dried-up
watercourse,
until
he
came
to
the
retired
corner,
screened
with
rocks,
where
the
faithful
animals
had
been
picketed.
The
girl
was
placed
upon
the
mule,
and
old
Ferrier
upon
one
of
the
horses,
with
his
money-bag,
while
Jefferson
Hope
led
the
other
along
the
precipitous
and
dangerous
path.

It
was
a
bewildering
route
for
anyone
who
was
not
accustomed
to
face
Nature
in
her
wildest
moods.
On
the
one
side
a
great
crag
towered
up
a
thousand
feet
or
more,
black,
stern,
and
menacing,
with
long
basaltic
columns
upon
its
rugged
surface
like
the
ribs
of
some
petrified
monster.
On
the
other
hand
a
wild
chaos
of
boulders
and
debris
made
all
advance
impossible.
Between
the
two
ran
the
irregular
track,
so
narrow
in
places
that
they
had
to
travel
in
Indian
file,
and
so
rough
that
only
practised
riders
could
have
traversed
it
at
all.
Yet
in
spite
of
all
dangers
and
difficulties,
the
hearts
of
the
fugitives
were
light
within
them,
for
every
step
increased
the
distance
between
them
and
the
terrible
despotism
from
which
they
were
flying.

They
soon
had
a
proof,
however,
that
they
were
still
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Saints.
They
had
reached
the
very
wildest
and
most
desolate
portion
of
the
pass
when
the
girl
gave
a
startled
cry,
and
pointed
upwards.
On
a
rock
which
overlooked
the
track,
showing
out
dark
and
plain
against
the
sky,
there
stood
a
solitary
sentinel.
He
saw
them
as
soon
as
they
perceived
him,
and
his
military
challenge
of
“Who
goes
there?”
rang
through
the
silent
ravine.

“Travellers
for
Nevada,”
said
Jefferson
Hope,
with
his
hand
upon
the
rifle
which
hung
by
his
saddle.

They
could
see
the
lonely
watcher
fingering
his
gun,
and
peering
down
at
them
as
if
dissatisfied
at
their
reply.

“By
whose
permission?”
he
asked.

“The
Holy
Four,”
answered
Ferrier.
His
Mormon
experiences
had
taught
him
that
that
was
the
highest
authority
to
which
he
could
refer.

“Nine
from
seven,”
cried
the
sentinel.

“Seven
from
five,”
returned
Jefferson
Hope
promptly,
remembering
the
countersign
which
he
had
heard
in
the
garden.

“Pass,
and
the
Lord
go
with
you,”
said
the
voice
from
above.
Beyond
his
post
the
path
broadened
out,
and
the
horses
were
able
to
break
into
a
trot.
Looking
back,
they
could
see
the
solitary
watcher
leaning
upon
his
gun,
and
knew
that
they
had
passed
the
outlying
post
of
the
chosen
people,
and
that
freedom
lay
before
them.





CHAPTER
V.
THE
AVENGING
ANGELS.

ALL
night
their
course
lay
through
intricate
defiles
and
over
irregular
and
rock-strewn
paths.
More
than
once
they
lost
their
way,
but
Hope’s
intimate
knowledge
of
the
mountains
enabled
them
to
regain
the
track
once
more.
When
morning
broke,
a
scene
of
marvellous
though
savage
beauty
lay
before
them.
In
every
direction
the
great
snow-capped
peaks
hemmed
them
in,
peeping
over
each
other’s
shoulders
to
the
far
horizon.
So
steep
were
the
rocky
banks
on
either
side
of
them,
that
the
larch
and
the
pine
seemed
to
be
suspended
over
their
heads,
and
to
need
only
a
gust
of
wind
to
come
hurtling
down
upon
them.
Nor
was
the
fear
entirely
an
illusion,
for
the
barren
valley
was
thickly
strewn
with
trees
and
boulders
which
had
fallen
in
a
similar
manner.
Even
as
they
passed,
a
great
rock
came
thundering
down
with
a
hoarse
rattle
which
woke
the
echoes
in
the
silent
gorges,
and
startled
the
weary
horses
into
a
gallop.

As
the
sun
rose
slowly
above
the
eastern
horizon,
the
caps
of
the
great
mountains
lit
up
one
after
the
other,
like
lamps
at
a
festival,
until
they
were
all
ruddy
and
glowing.
The
magnificent
spectacle
cheered
the
hearts
of
the
three
fugitives
and
gave
them
fresh
energy.
At
a
wild
torrent
which
swept
out
of
a
ravine
they
called
a
halt
and
watered
their
horses,
while
they
partook
of
a
hasty
breakfast.
Lucy
and
her
father
would
fain
have
rested
longer,
but
Jefferson
Hope
was
inexorable.
“They
will
be
upon
our
track
by
this
time,”
he
said.
“Everything
depends
upon
our
speed.
Once
safe
in
Carson
we
may
rest
for
the
remainder
of
our
lives.”

During
the
whole
of
that
day
they
struggled
on
through
the
defiles,
and
by
evening
they
calculated
that
they
were
more
than
thirty
miles
from
their
enemies.
At
night-time
they
chose
the
base
of
a
beetling
crag,
where
the
rocks
offered
some
protection
from
the
chill
wind,
and
there
huddled
together
for
warmth,
they
enjoyed
a
few
hours’
sleep.
Before
daybreak,
however,
they
were
up
and
on
their
way
once
more.
They
had
seen
no
signs
of
any
pursuers,
and
Jefferson
Hope
began
to
think
that
they
were
fairly
out
of
the
reach
of
the
terrible
organization
whose
enmity
they
had
incurred.
He
little
knew
how
far
that
iron
grasp
could
reach,
or
how
soon
it
was
to
close
upon
them
and
crush
them.

About
the
middle
of
the
second
day
of
their
flight
their
scanty
store
of
provisions
began
to
run
out.
This
gave
the
hunter
little
uneasiness,
however,
for
there
was
game
to
be
had
among
the
mountains,
and
he
had
frequently
before
had
to
depend
upon
his
rifle
for
the
needs
of
life.
Choosing
a
sheltered
nook,
he
piled
together
a
few
dried
branches
and
made
a
blazing
fire,
at
which
his
companions
might
warm
themselves,
for
they
were
now
nearly
five
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
level,
and
the
air
was
bitter
and
keen.
Having
tethered
the
horses,
and
bade
Lucy
adieu,
he
threw
his
gun
over
his
shoulder,
and
set
out
in
search
of
whatever
chance
might
throw
in
his
way.
Looking
back
he
saw
the
old
man
and
the
young
girl
crouching
over
the
blazing
fire,
while
the
three
animals
stood
motionless
in
the
back-ground.
Then
the
intervening
rocks
hid
them
from
his
view.

He
walked
for
a
couple
of
miles
through
one
ravine
after
another
without
success,
though
from
the
marks
upon
the
bark
of
the
trees,
and
other
indications,
he
judged
that
there
were
numerous
bears
in
the
vicinity.
At
last,
after
two
or
three
hours’
fruitless
search,
he
was
thinking
of
turning
back
in
despair,
when
casting
his
eyes
upwards
he
saw
a
sight
which
sent
a
thrill
of
pleasure
through
his
heart.
On
the
edge
of
a
jutting
pinnacle,
three
or
four
hundred
feet
above
him,
there
stood
a
creature
somewhat
resembling
a
sheep
in
appearance,
but
armed
with
a
pair
of
gigantic
horns.
The
big-horn—for
so
it
is
called—was
acting,
probably,
as
a
guardian
over
a
flock
which
were
invisible
to
the
hunter;
but
fortunately
it
was
heading
in
the
opposite
direction,
and
had
not
perceived
him.
Lying
on
his
face,
he
rested
his
rifle
upon
a
rock,
and
took
a
long
and
steady
aim
before
drawing
the
trigger.
The
animal
sprang
into
the
air,
tottered
for
a
moment
upon
the
edge
of
the
precipice,
and
then
came
crashing
down
into
the
valley
beneath.

The
creature
was
too
unwieldy
to
lift,
so
the
hunter
contented
himself
with
cutting
away
one
haunch
and
part
of
the
flank.
With
this
trophy
over
his
shoulder,
he
hastened
to
retrace
his
steps,
for
the
evening
was
already
drawing
in.
He
had
hardly
started,
however,
before
he
realized
the
difficulty
which
faced
him.
In
his
eagerness
he
had
wandered
far
past
the
ravines
which
were
known
to
him,
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
pick
out
the
path
which
he
had
taken.
The
valley
in
which
he
found
himself
divided
and
sub-divided
into
many
gorges,
which
were
so
like
each
other
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other.
He
followed
one
for
a
mile
or
more
until
he
came
to
a
mountain
torrent
which
he
was
sure
that
he
had
never
seen
before.
Convinced
that
he
had
taken
the
wrong
turn,
he
tried
another,
but
with
the
same
result.
Night
was
coming
on
rapidly,
and
it
was
almost
dark
before
he
at
last
found
himself
in
a
defile
which
was
familiar
to
him.
Even
then
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
keep
to
the
right
track,
for
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen,
and
the
high
cliffs
on
either
side
made
the
obscurity
more
profound.
Weighed
down
with
his
burden,
and
weary
from
his
exertions,
he
stumbled
along,
keeping
up
his
heart
by
the
reflection
that
every
step
brought
him
nearer
to
Lucy,
and
that
he
carried
with
him
enough
to
ensure
them
food
for
the
remainder
of
their
journey.

He
had
now
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
very
defile
in
which
he
had
left
them.
Even
in
the
darkness
he
could
recognize
the
outline
of
the
cliffs
which
bounded
it.
They
must,
he
reflected,
be
awaiting
him
anxiously,
for
he
had
been
absent
nearly
five
hours.
In
the
gladness
of
his
heart
he
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
made
the
glen
re-echo
to
a
loud
halloo
as
a
signal
that
he
was
coming.
He
paused
and
listened
for
an
answer.
None
came
save
his
own
cry,
which
clattered
up
the
dreary
silent
ravines,
and
was
borne
back
to
his
ears
in
countless
repetitions.
Again
he
shouted,
even
louder
than
before,
and
again
no
whisper
came
back
from
the
friends
whom
he
had
left
such
a
short
time
ago.
A
vague,
nameless
dread
came
over
him,
and
he
hurried
onwards
frantically,
dropping
the
precious
food
in
his
agitation.

When
he
turned
the
corner,
he
came
full
in
sight
of
the
spot
where
the
fire
had
been
lit.
There
was
still
a
glowing
pile
of
wood
ashes
there,
but
it
had
evidently
not
been
tended
since
his
departure.
The
same
dead
silence
still
reigned
all
round.
With
his
fears
all
changed
to
convictions,
he
hurried
on.
There
was
no
living
creature
near
the
remains
of
the
fire:
animals,
man,
maiden,
all
were
gone.
It
was
only
too
clear
that
some
sudden
and
terrible
disaster
had
occurred
during
his
absence—a
disaster
which
had
embraced
them
all,
and
yet
had
left
no
traces
behind
it.

Bewildered
and
stunned
by
this
blow,
Jefferson
Hope
felt
his
head
spin
round,
and
had
to
lean
upon
his
rifle
to
save
himself
from
falling.
He
was
essentially
a
man
of
action,
however,
and
speedily
recovered
from
his
temporary
impotence.
Seizing
a
half-consumed
piece
of
wood
from
the
smouldering
fire,
he
blew
it
into
a
flame,
and
proceeded
with
its
help
to
examine
the
little
camp.
The
ground
was
all
stamped
down
by
the
feet
of
horses,
showing
that
a
large
party
of
mounted
men
had
overtaken
the
fugitives,
and
the
direction
of
their
tracks
proved
that
they
had
afterwards
turned
back
to
Salt
Lake
City.
Had
they
carried
back
both
of
his
companions
with
them?
Jefferson
Hope
had
almost
persuaded
himself
that
they
must
have
done
so,
when
his
eye
fell
upon
an
object
which
made
every
nerve
of
his
body
tingle
within
him.
A
little
way
on
one
side
of
the
camp
was
a
low-lying
heap
of
reddish
soil,
which
had
assuredly
not
been
there
before.
There
was
no
mistaking
it
for
anything
but
a
newly-dug
grave.
As
the
young
hunter
approached
it,
he
perceived
that
a
stick
had
been
planted
on
it,
with
a
sheet
of
paper
stuck
in
the
cleft
fork
of
it.
The
inscription
upon
the
paper
was
brief,
but
to
the
point:

























JOHN
FERRIER,

















FORMERLY
OF
SALT
LAKE
CITY,
22




















Died
August
4th,
1860.

The
sturdy
old
man,
whom
he
had
left
so
short
a
time
before,
was
gone,
then,
and
this
was
all
his
epitaph.
Jefferson
Hope
looked
wildly
round
to
see
if
there
was
a
second
grave,
but
there
was
no
sign
of
one.
Lucy
had
been
carried
back
by
their
terrible
pursuers
to
fulfil
her
original
destiny,
by
becoming
one
of
the
harem
of
the
Elder’s
son.
As
the
young
fellow
realized
the
certainty
of
her
fate,
and
his
own
powerlessness
to
prevent
it,
he
wished
that
he,
too,
was
lying
with
the
old
farmer
in
his
last
silent
resting-place.

Again,
however,
his
active
spirit
shook
off
the
lethargy
which
springs
from
despair.
If
there
was
nothing
else
left
to
him,
he
could
at
least
devote
his
life
to
revenge.
With
indomitable
patience
and
perseverance,
Jefferson
Hope
possessed
also
a
power
of
sustained
vindictiveness,
which
he
may
have
learned
from
the
Indians
amongst
whom
he
had
lived.
As
he
stood
by
the
desolate
fire,
he
felt
that
the
only
one
thing
which
could
assuage
his
grief
would
be
thorough
and
complete
retribution,
brought
by
his
own
hand
upon
his
enemies.
His
strong
will
and
untiring
energy
should,
he
determined,
be
devoted
to
that
one
end.
With
a
grim,
white
face,
he
retraced
his
steps
to
where
he
had
dropped
the
food,
and
having
stirred
up
the
smouldering
fire,
he
cooked
enough
to
last
him
for
a
few
days.
This
he
made
up
into
a
bundle,
and,
tired
as
he
was,
he
set
himself
to
walk
back
through
the
mountains
upon
the
track
of
the
avenging
angels.

For
five
days
he
toiled
footsore
and
weary
through
the
defiles
which
he
had
already
traversed
on
horseback.
At
night
he
flung
himself
down
among
the
rocks,
and
snatched
a
few
hours
of
sleep;
but
before
daybreak
he
was
always
well
on
his
way.
On
the
sixth
day,
he
reached
the
Eagle
Cañon,
from
which
they
had
commenced
their
ill-fated
flight.
Thence
he
could
look
down
upon
the
home
of
the
saints.
Worn
and
exhausted,
he
leaned
upon
his
rifle
and
shook
his
gaunt
hand
fiercely
at
the
silent
widespread
city
beneath
him.
As
he
looked
at
it,
he
observed
that
there
were
flags
in
some
of
the
principal
streets,
and
other
signs
of
festivity.
He
was
still
speculating
as
to
what
this
might
mean
when
he
heard
the
clatter
of
horse’s
hoofs,
and
saw
a
mounted
man
riding
towards
him.
As
he
approached,
he
recognized
him
as
a
Mormon
named
Cowper,
to
whom
he
had
rendered
services
at
different
times.
He
therefore
accosted
him
when
he
got
up
to
him,
with
the
object
of
finding
out
what
Lucy
Ferrier’s
fate
had
been.

“I
am
Jefferson
Hope,”
he
said.
“You
remember
me.”

The
Mormon
looked
at
him
with
undisguised
astonishment—indeed,
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
in
this
tattered,
unkempt
wanderer,
with
ghastly
white
face
and
fierce,
wild
eyes,
the
spruce
young
hunter
of
former
days.
Having,
however,
at
last,
satisfied
himself
as
to
his
identity,
the
man’s
surprise
changed
to
consternation.

“You
are
mad
to
come
here,”
he
cried.
“It
is
as
much
as
my
own
life
is
worth
to
be
seen
talking
with
you.
There
is
a
warrant
against
you
from
the
Holy
Four
for
assisting
the
Ferriers
away.”

“I
don’t
fear
them,
or
their
warrant,”
Hope
said,
earnestly.
“You
must
know
something
of
this
matter,
Cowper.
I
conjure
you
by
everything
you
hold
dear
to
answer
a
few
questions.
We
have
always
been
friends.
For
God’s
sake,
don’t
refuse
to
answer
me.”

“What
is
it?”
the
Mormon
asked
uneasily.
“Be
quick.
The
very
rocks
have
ears
and
the
trees
eyes.”

“What
has
become
of
Lucy
Ferrier?”

“She
was
married
yesterday
to
young
Drebber.
Hold
up,
man,
hold
up,
you
have
no
life
left
in
you.”

“Don’t
mind
me,”
said
Hope
faintly.
He
was
white
to
the
very
lips,
and
had
sunk
down
on
the
stone
against
which
he
had
been
leaning.
“Married,
you
say?”

“Married
yesterday—that’s
what
those
flags
are
for
on
the
Endowment
House.
There
was
some
words
between
young
Drebber
and
young
Stangerson
as
to
which
was
to
have
her.
They’d
both
been
in
the
party
that
followed
them,
and
Stangerson
had
shot
her
father,
which
seemed
to
give
him
the
best
claim;
but
when
they
argued
it
out
in
council,
Drebber’s
party
was
the
stronger,
so
the
Prophet
gave
her
over
to
him.
No
one
won’t
have
her
very
long
though,
for
I
saw
death
in
her
face
yesterday.
She
is
more
like
a
ghost
than
a
woman.
Are
you
off,
then?”

“Yes,
I
am
off,”
said
Jefferson
Hope,
who
had
risen
from
his
seat.
His
face
might
have
been
chiselled
out
of
marble,
so
hard
and
set
was
its
expression,
while
its
eyes
glowed
with
a
baleful
light.

“Where
are
you
going?”

“Never
mind,”
he
answered;
and,
slinging
his
weapon
over
his
shoulder,
strode
off
down
the
gorge
and
so
away
into
the
heart
of
the
mountains
to
the
haunts
of
the
wild
beasts.
Amongst
them
all
there
was
none
so
fierce
and
so
dangerous
as
himself.

The
prediction
of
the
Mormon
was
only
too
well
fulfilled.
Whether
it
was
the
terrible
death
of
her
father
or
the
effects
of
the
hateful
marriage
into
which
she
had
been
forced,
poor
Lucy
never
held
up
her
head
again,
but
pined
away
and
died
within
a
month.
Her
sottish
husband,
who
had
married
her
principally
for
the
sake
of
John
Ferrier’s
property,
did
not
affect
any
great
grief
at
his
bereavement;
but
his
other
wives
mourned
over
her,
and
sat
up
with
her
the
night
before
the
burial,
as
is
the
Mormon
custom.
They
were
grouped
round
the
bier
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning,
when,
to
their
inexpressible
fear
and
astonishment,
the
door
was
flung
open,
and
a
savage-looking,
weather-beaten
man
in
tattered
garments
strode
into
the
room.
Without
a
glance
or
a
word
to
the
cowering
women,
he
walked
up
to
the
white
silent
figure
which
had
once
contained
the
pure
soul
of
Lucy
Ferrier.
Stooping
over
her,
he
pressed
his
lips
reverently
to
her
cold
forehead,
and
then,
snatching
up
her
hand,
he
took
the
wedding-ring
from
her
finger.
“She
shall
not
be
buried
in
that,”
he
cried
with
a
fierce
snarl,
and
before
an
alarm
could
be
raised
sprang
down
the
stairs
and
was
gone.
So
strange
and
so
brief
was
the
episode,
that
the
watchers
might
have
found
it
hard
to
believe
it
themselves
or
persuade
other
people
of
it,
had
it
not
been
for
the
undeniable
fact
that
the
circlet
of
gold
which
marked
her
as
having
been
a
bride
had
disappeared.

For
some
months
Jefferson
Hope
lingered
among
the
mountains,
leading
a
strange
wild
life,
and
nursing
in
his
heart
the
fierce
desire
for
vengeance
which
possessed
him.
Tales
were
told
in
the
City
of
the
weird
figure
which
was
seen
prowling
about
the
suburbs,
and
which
haunted
the
lonely
mountain
gorges.
Once
a
bullet
whistled
through
Stangerson’s
window
and
flattened
itself
upon
the
wall
within
a
foot
of
him.
On
another
occasion,
as
Drebber
passed
under
a
cliff
a
great
boulder
crashed
down
on
him,
and
he
only
escaped
a
terrible
death
by
throwing
himself
upon
his
face.
The
two
young
Mormons
were
not
long
in
discovering
the
reason
of
these
attempts
upon
their
lives,
and
led
repeated
expeditions
into
the
mountains
in
the
hope
of
capturing
or
killing
their
enemy,
but
always
without
success.
Then
they
adopted
the
precaution
of
never
going
out
alone
or
after
nightfall,
and
of
having
their
houses
guarded.
After
a
time
they
were
able
to
relax
these
measures,
for
nothing
was
either
heard
or
seen
of
their
opponent,
and
they
hoped
that
time
had
cooled
his
vindictiveness.

Far
from
doing
so,
it
had,
if
anything,
augmented
it.
The
hunter’s
mind
was
of
a
hard,
unyielding
nature,
and
the
predominant
idea
of
revenge
had
taken
such
complete
possession
of
it
that
there
was
no
room
for
any
other
emotion.
He
was,
however,
above
all
things
practical.
He
soon
realized
that
even
his
iron
constitution
could
not
stand
the
incessant
strain
which
he
was
putting
upon
it.
Exposure
and
want
of
wholesome
food
were
wearing
him
out.
If
he
died
like
a
dog
among
the
mountains,
what
was
to
become
of
his
revenge
then?
And
yet
such
a
death
was
sure
to
overtake
him
if
he
persisted.
He
felt
that
that
was
to
play
his
enemy’s
game,
so
he
reluctantly
returned
to
the
old
Nevada
mines,
there
to
recruit
his
health
and
to
amass
money
enough
to
allow
him
to
pursue
his
object
without
privation.

His
intention
had
been
to
be
absent
a
year
at
the
most,
but
a
combination
of
unforeseen
circumstances
prevented
his
leaving
the
mines
for
nearly
five.
At
the
end
of
that
time,
however,
his
memory
of
his
wrongs
and
his
craving
for
revenge
were
quite
as
keen
as
on
that
memorable
night
when
he
had
stood
by
John
Ferrier’s
grave.
Disguised,
and
under
an
assumed
name,
he
returned
to
Salt
Lake
City,
careless
what
became
of
his
own
life,
as
long
as
he
obtained
what
he
knew
to
be
justice.
There
he
found
evil
tidings
awaiting
him.
There
had
been
a
schism
among
the
Chosen
People
a
few
months
before,
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
Church
having
rebelled
against
the
authority
of
the
Elders,
and
the
result
had
been
the
secession
of
a
certain
number
of
the
malcontents,
who
had
left
Utah
and
become
Gentiles.
Among
these
had
been
Drebber
and
Stangerson;
and
no
one
knew
whither
they
had
gone.
Rumour
reported
that
Drebber
had
managed
to
convert
a
large
part
of
his
property
into
money,
and
that
he
had
departed
a
wealthy
man,
while
his
companion,
Stangerson,
was
comparatively
poor.
There
was
no
clue
at
all,
however,
as
to
their
whereabouts.

Many
a
man,
however
vindictive,
would
have
abandoned
all
thought
of
revenge
in
the
face
of
such
a
difficulty,
but
Jefferson
Hope
never
faltered
for
a
moment.
With
the
small
competence
he
possessed,
eked
out
by
such
employment
as
he
could
pick
up,
he
travelled
from
town
to
town
through
the
United
States
in
quest
of
his
enemies.
Year
passed
into
year,
his
black
hair
turned
grizzled,
but
still
he
wandered
on,
a
human
bloodhound,
with
his
mind
wholly
set
upon
the
one
object
upon
which
he
had
devoted
his
life.
At
last
his
perseverance
was
rewarded.
It
was
but
a
glance
of
a
face
in
a
window,
but
that
one
glance
told
him
that
Cleveland
in
Ohio
possessed
the
men
whom
he
was
in
pursuit
of.
He
returned
to
his
miserable
lodgings
with
his
plan
of
vengeance
all
arranged.
It
chanced,
however,
that
Drebber,
looking
from
his
window,
had
recognized
the
vagrant
in
the
street,
and
had
read
murder
in
his
eyes.
He
hurried
before
a
justice
of
the
peace,
accompanied
by
Stangerson,
who
had
become
his
private
secretary,
and
represented
to
him
that
they
were
in
danger
of
their
lives
from
the
jealousy
and
hatred
of
an
old
rival.
That
evening
Jefferson
Hope
was
taken
into
custody,
and
not
being
able
to
find
sureties,
was
detained
for
some
weeks.
When
at
last
he
was
liberated,
it
was
only
to
find
that
Drebber’s
house
was
deserted,
and
that
he
and
his
secretary
had
departed
for
Europe.

Again
the
avenger
had
been
foiled,
and
again
his
concentrated
hatred
urged
him
to
continue
the
pursuit.
Funds
were
wanting,
however,
and
for
some
time
he
had
to
return
to
work,
saving
every
dollar
for
his
approaching
journey.
At
last,
having
collected
enough
to
keep
life
in
him,
he
departed
for
Europe,
and
tracked
his
enemies
from
city
to
city,
working
his
way
in
any
menial
capacity,
but
never
overtaking
the
fugitives.
When
he
reached
St.
Petersburg
they
had
departed
for
Paris;
and
when
he
followed
them
there
he
learned
that
they
had
just
set
off
for
Copenhagen.
At
the
Danish
capital
he
was
again
a
few
days
late,
for
they
had
journeyed
on
to
London,
where
he
at
last
succeeded
in
running
them
to
earth.
As
to
what
occurred
there,
we
cannot
do
better
than
quote
the
old
hunter’s
own
account,
as
duly
recorded
in
Dr.
Watson’s
Journal,
to
which
we
are
already
under
such
obligations.





CHAPTER
VI.
A
CONTINUATION
OF
THE
REMINISCENCES
OF
JOHN
WATSON,
M.D.

OUR
prisoner’s
furious
resistance
did
not
apparently
indicate
any
ferocity
in
his
disposition
towards
ourselves,
for
on
finding
himself
powerless,
he
smiled
in
an
affable
manner,
and
expressed
his
hopes
that
he
had
not
hurt
any
of
us
in
the
scuffle.
“I
guess
you’re
going
to
take
me
to
the
police-station,”
he
remarked
to
Sherlock
Holmes.
“My
cab’s
at
the
door.
If
you’ll
loose
my
legs
I’ll
walk
down
to
it.
I’m
not
so
light
to
lift
as
I
used
to
be.”

Gregson
and
Lestrade
exchanged
glances
as
if
they
thought
this
proposition
rather
a
bold
one;
but
Holmes
at
once
took
the
prisoner
at
his
word,
and
loosened
the
towel
which
we
had
bound
round
his
ancles.
23
He
rose
and
stretched
his
legs,
as
though
to
assure
himself
that
they
were
free
once
more.
I
remember
that
I
thought
to
myself,
as
I
eyed
him,
that
I
had
seldom
seen
a
more
powerfully
built
man;
and
his
dark
sunburned
face
bore
an
expression
of
determination
and
energy
which
was
as
formidable
as
his
personal
strength.

“If
there’s
a
vacant
place
for
a
chief
of
the
police,
I
reckon
you
are
the
man
for
it,”
he
said,
gazing
with
undisguised
admiration
at
my
fellow-lodger.
“The
way
you
kept
on
my
trail
was
a
caution.”

“You
had
better
come
with
me,”
said
Holmes
to
the
two
detectives.

“I
can
drive
you,”
said
Lestrade.

“Good!
and
Gregson
can
come
inside
with
me.
You
too,
Doctor,
you
have
taken
an
interest
in
the
case
and
may
as
well
stick
to
us.”

I
assented
gladly,
and
we
all
descended
together.
Our
prisoner
made
no
attempt
at
escape,
but
stepped
calmly
into
the
cab
which
had
been
his,
and
we
followed
him.
Lestrade
mounted
the
box,
whipped
up
the
horse,
and
brought
us
in
a
very
short
time
to
our
destination.
We
were
ushered
into
a
small
chamber
where
a
police
Inspector
noted
down
our
prisoner’s
name
and
the
names
of
the
men
with
whose
murder
he
had
been
charged.
The
official
was
a
white-faced
unemotional
man,
who
went
through
his
duties
in
a
dull
mechanical
way.
“The
prisoner
will
be
put
before
the
magistrates
in
the
course
of
the
week,”
he
said;
“in
the
mean
time,
Mr.
Jefferson
Hope,
have
you
anything
that
you
wish
to
say?
I
must
warn
you
that
your
words
will
be
taken
down,
and
may
be
used
against
you.”

“I’ve
got
a
good
deal
to
say,”
our
prisoner
said
slowly.
“I
want
to
tell
you
gentlemen
all
about
it.”

“Hadn’t
you
better
reserve
that
for
your
trial?”
asked
the
Inspector.

“I
may
never
be
tried,”
he
answered.
“You
needn’t
look
startled.
It
isn’t
suicide
I
am
thinking
of.
Are
you
a
Doctor?”
He
turned
his
fierce
dark
eyes
upon
me
as
he
asked
this
last
question.

“Yes;
I
am,”
I
answered.

“Then
put
your
hand
here,”
he
said,
with
a
smile,
motioning
with
his
manacled
wrists
towards
his
chest.

I
did
so;
and
became
at
once
conscious
of
an
extraordinary
throbbing
and
commotion
which
was
going
on
inside.
The
walls
of
his
chest
seemed
to
thrill
and
quiver
as
a
frail
building
would
do
inside
when
some
powerful
engine
was
at
work.
In
the
silence
of
the
room
I
could
hear
a
dull
humming
and
buzzing
noise
which
proceeded
from
the
same
source.

“Why,”
I
cried,
“you
have
an
aortic
aneurism!”

“That’s
what
they
call
it,”
he
said,
placidly.
“I
went
to
a
Doctor
last
week
about
it,
and
he
told
me
that
it
is
bound
to
burst
before
many
days
passed.
It
has
been
getting
worse
for
years.
I
got
it
from
over-exposure
and
under-feeding
among
the
Salt
Lake
Mountains.
I’ve
done
my
work
now,
and
I
don’t
care
how
soon
I
go,
but
I
should
like
to
leave
some
account
of
the
business
behind
me.
I
don’t
want
to
be
remembered
as
a
common
cut-throat.”

The
Inspector
and
the
two
detectives
had
a
hurried
discussion
as
to
the
advisability
of
allowing
him
to
tell
his
story.

“Do
you
consider,
Doctor,
that
there
is
immediate
danger?”
the
former
asked,
24

“Most
certainly
there
is,”
I
answered.

“In
that
case
it
is
clearly
our
duty,
in
the
interests
of
justice,
to
take
his
statement,”
said
the
Inspector.
“You
are
at
liberty,
sir,
to
give
your
account,
which
I
again
warn
you
will
be
taken
down.”

“I’ll
sit
down,
with
your
leave,”
the
prisoner
said,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word.
“This
aneurism
of
mine
makes
me
easily
tired,
and
the
tussle
we
had
half
an
hour
ago
has
not
mended
matters.
I’m
on
the
brink
of
the
grave,
and
I
am
not
likely
to
lie
to
you.
Every
word
I
say
is
the
absolute
truth,
and
how
you
use
it
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
to
me.”

With
these
words,
Jefferson
Hope
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
the
following
remarkable
statement.
He
spoke
in
a
calm
and
methodical
manner,
as
though
the
events
which
he
narrated
were
commonplace
enough.
I
can
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
the
subjoined
account,
for
I
have
had
access
to
Lestrade’s
note-book,
in
which
the
prisoner’s
words
were
taken
down
exactly
as
they
were
uttered.

“It
don’t
much
matter
to
you
why
I
hated
these
men,”
he
said;
“it’s
enough
that
they
were
guilty
of
the
death
of
two
human
beings—a
father
and
a
daughter—and
that
they
had,
therefore,
forfeited
their
own
lives.
After
the
lapse
of
time
that
has
passed
since
their
crime,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
secure
a
conviction
against
them
in
any
court.
I
knew
of
their
guilt
though,
and
I
determined
that
I
should
be
judge,
jury,
and
executioner
all
rolled
into
one.
You’d
have
done
the
same,
if
you
have
any
manhood
in
you,
if
you
had
been
in
my
place.

“That
girl
that
I
spoke
of
was
to
have
married
me
twenty
years
ago.
She
was
forced
into
marrying
that
same
Drebber,
and
broke
her
heart
over
it.
I
took
the
marriage
ring
from
her
dead
finger,
and
I
vowed
that
his
dying
eyes
should
rest
upon
that
very
ring,
and
that
his
last
thoughts
should
be
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
punished.
I
have
carried
it
about
with
me,
and
have
followed
him
and
his
accomplice
over
two
continents
until
I
caught
them.
They
thought
to
tire
me
out,
but
they
could
not
do
it.
If
I
die
to-morrow,
as
is
likely
enough,
I
die
knowing
that
my
work
in
this
world
is
done,
and
well
done.
They
have
perished,
and
by
my
hand.
There
is
nothing
left
for
me
to
hope
for,
or
to
desire.

“They
were
rich
and
I
was
poor,
so
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
me
to
follow
them.
When
I
got
to
London
my
pocket
was
about
empty,
and
I
found
that
I
must
turn
my
hand
to
something
for
my
living.
Driving
and
riding
are
as
natural
to
me
as
walking,
so
I
applied
at
a
cabowner’s
office,
and
soon
got
employment.
I
was
to
bring
a
certain
sum
a
week
to
the
owner,
and
whatever
was
over
that
I
might
keep
for
myself.
There
was
seldom
much
over,
but
I
managed
to
scrape
along
somehow.
The
hardest
job
was
to
learn
my
way
about,
for
I
reckon
that
of
all
the
mazes
that
ever
were
contrived,
this
city
is
the
most
confusing.
I
had
a
map
beside
me
though,
and
when
once
I
had
spotted
the
principal
hotels
and
stations,
I
got
on
pretty
well.

“It
was
some
time
before
I
found
out
where
my
two
gentlemen
were
living;
but
I
inquired
and
inquired
until
at
last
I
dropped
across
them.
They
were
at
a
boarding-house
at
Camberwell,
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
river.
When
once
I
found
them
out
I
knew
that
I
had
them
at
my
mercy.
I
had
grown
my
beard,
and
there
was
no
chance
of
their
recognizing
me.
I
would
dog
them
and
follow
them
until
I
saw
my
opportunity.
I
was
determined
that
they
should
not
escape
me
again.

“They
were
very
near
doing
it
for
all
that.
Go
where
they
would
about
London,
I
was
always
at
their
heels.
Sometimes
I
followed
them
on
my
cab,
and
sometimes
on
foot,
but
the
former
was
the
best,
for
then
they
could
not
get
away
from
me.
It
was
only
early
in
the
morning
or
late
at
night
that
I
could
earn
anything,
so
that
I
began
to
get
behind
hand
with
my
employer.
I
did
not
mind
that,
however,
as
long
as
I
could
lay
my
hand
upon
the
men
I
wanted.

“They
were
very
cunning,
though.
They
must
have
thought
that
there
was
some
chance
of
their
being
followed,
for
they
would
never
go
out
alone,
and
never
after
nightfall.
During
two
weeks
I
drove
behind
them
every
day,
and
never
once
saw
them
separate.
Drebber
himself
was
drunk
half
the
time,
but
Stangerson
was
not
to
be
caught
napping.
I
watched
them
late
and
early,
but
never
saw
the
ghost
of
a
chance;
but
I
was
not
discouraged,
for
something
told
me
that
the
hour
had
almost
come.
My
only
fear
was
that
this
thing
in
my
chest
might
burst
a
little
too
soon
and
leave
my
work
undone.

“At
last,
one
evening
I
was
driving
up
and
down
Torquay
Terrace,
as
the
street
was
called
in
which
they
boarded,
when
I
saw
a
cab
drive
up
to
their
door.
Presently
some
luggage
was
brought
out,
and
after
a
time
Drebber
and
Stangerson
followed
it,
and
drove
off.
I
whipped
up
my
horse
and
kept
within
sight
of
them,
feeling
very
ill
at
ease,
for
I
feared
that
they
were
going
to
shift
their
quarters.
At
Euston
Station
they
got
out,
and
I
left
a
boy
to
hold
my
horse,
and
followed
them
on
to
the
platform.
I
heard
them
ask
for
the
Liverpool
train,
and
the
guard
answer
that
one
had
just
gone
and
there
would
not
be
another
for
some
hours.
Stangerson
seemed
to
be
put
out
at
that,
but
Drebber
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise.
I
got
so
close
to
them
in
the
bustle
that
I
could
hear
every
word
that
passed
between
them.
Drebber
said
that
he
had
a
little
business
of
his
own
to
do,
and
that
if
the
other
would
wait
for
him
he
would
soon
rejoin
him.
His
companion
remonstrated
with
him,
and
reminded
him
that
they
had
resolved
to
stick
together.
Drebber
answered
that
the
matter
was
a
delicate
one,
and
that
he
must
go
alone.
I
could
not
catch
what
Stangerson
said
to
that,
but
the
other
burst
out
swearing,
and
reminded
him
that
he
was
nothing
more
than
his
paid
servant,
and
that
he
must
not
presume
to
dictate
to
him.
On
that
the
Secretary
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job,
and
simply
bargained
with
him
that
if
he
missed
the
last
train
he
should
rejoin
him
at
Halliday’s
Private
Hotel;
to
which
Drebber
answered
that
he
would
be
back
on
the
platform
before
eleven,
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
station.

“The
moment
for
which
I
had
waited
so
long
had
at
last
come.
I
had
my
enemies
within
my
power.
Together
they
could
protect
each
other,
but
singly
they
were
at
my
mercy.
I
did
not
act,
however,
with
undue
precipitation.
My
plans
were
already
formed.
There
is
no
satisfaction
in
vengeance
unless
the
offender
has
time
to
realize
who
it
is
that
strikes
him,
and
why
retribution
has
come
upon
him.
I
had
my
plans
arranged
by
which
I
should
have
the
opportunity
of
making
the
man
who
had
wronged
me
understand
that
his
old
sin
had
found
him
out.
It
chanced
that
some
days
before
a
gentleman
who
had
been
engaged
in
looking
over
some
houses
in
the
Brixton
Road
had
dropped
the
key
of
one
of
them
in
my
carriage.
It
was
claimed
that
same
evening,
and
returned;
but
in
the
interval
I
had
taken
a
moulding
of
it,
and
had
a
duplicate
constructed.
By
means
of
this
I
had
access
to
at
least
one
spot
in
this
great
city
where
I
could
rely
upon
being
free
from
interruption.
How
to
get
Drebber
to
that
house
was
the
difficult
problem
which
I
had
now
to
solve.

“He
walked
down
the
road
and
went
into
one
or
two
liquor
shops,
staying
for
nearly
half-an-hour
in
the
last
of
them.
When
he
came
out
he
staggered
in
his
walk,
and
was
evidently
pretty
well
on.
There
was
a
hansom
just
in
front
of
me,
and
he
hailed
it.
I
followed
it
so
close
that
the
nose
of
my
horse
was
within
a
yard
of
his
driver
the
whole
way.
We
rattled
across
Waterloo
Bridge
and
through
miles
of
streets,
until,
to
my
astonishment,
we
found
ourselves
back
in
the
Terrace
in
which
he
had
boarded.
I
could
not
imagine
what
his
intention
was
in
returning
there;
but
I
went
on
and
pulled
up
my
cab
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
house.
He
entered
it,
and
his
hansom
drove
away.
Give
me
a
glass
of
water,
if
you
please.
My
mouth
gets
dry
with
the
talking.”

I
handed
him
the
glass,
and
he
drank
it
down.

“That’s
better,”
he
said.
“Well,
I
waited
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour,
or
more,
when
suddenly
there
came
a
noise
like
people
struggling
inside
the
house.
Next
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
two
men
appeared,
one
of
whom
was
Drebber,
and
the
other
was
a
young
chap
whom
I
had
never
seen
before.
This
fellow
had
Drebber
by
the
collar,
and
when
they
came
to
the
head
of
the
steps
he
gave
him
a
shove
and
a
kick
which
sent
him
half
across
the
road.
‘You
hound,’
he
cried,
shaking
his
stick
at
him;
‘I’ll
teach
you
to
insult
an
honest
girl!’
He
was
so
hot
that
I
think
he
would
have
thrashed
Drebber
with
his
cudgel,
only
that
the
cur
staggered
away
down
the
road
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him.
He
ran
as
far
as
the
corner,
and
then,
seeing
my
cab,
he
hailed
me
and
jumped
in.
‘Drive
me
to
Halliday’s
Private
Hotel,’
said
he.

“When
I
had
him
fairly
inside
my
cab,
my
heart
jumped
so
with
joy
that
I
feared
lest
at
this
last
moment
my
aneurism
might
go
wrong.
I
drove
along
slowly,
weighing
in
my
own
mind
what
it
was
best
to
do.
I
might
take
him
right
out
into
the
country,
and
there
in
some
deserted
lane
have
my
last
interview
with
him.
I
had
almost
decided
upon
this,
when
he
solved
the
problem
for
me.
The
craze
for
drink
had
seized
him
again,
and
he
ordered
me
to
pull
up
outside
a
gin
palace.
He
went
in,
leaving
word
that
I
should
wait
for
him.
There
he
remained
until
closing
time,
and
when
he
came
out
he
was
so
far
gone
that
I
knew
the
game
was
in
my
own
hands.

“Don’t
imagine
that
I
intended
to
kill
him
in
cold
blood.
It
would
only
have
been
rigid
justice
if
I
had
done
so,
but
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
it.
I
had
long
determined
that
he
should
have
a
show
for
his
life
if
he
chose
to
take
advantage
of
it.
Among
the
many
billets
which
I
have
filled
in
America
during
my
wandering
life,
I
was
once
janitor
and
sweeper
out
of
the
laboratory
at
York
College.
One
day
the
professor
was
lecturing
on
poisions,
25
and
he
showed
his
students
some
alkaloid,
as
he
called
it,
which
he
had
extracted
from
some
South
American
arrow
poison,
and
which
was
so
powerful
that
the
least
grain
meant
instant
death.
I
spotted
the
bottle
in
which
this
preparation
was
kept,
and
when
they
were
all
gone,
I
helped
myself
to
a
little
of
it.
I
was
a
fairly
good
dispenser,
so
I
worked
this
alkaloid
into
small,
soluble
pills,
and
each
pill
I
put
in
a
box
with
a
similar
pill
made
without
the
poison.
I
determined
at
the
time
that
when
I
had
my
chance,
my
gentlemen
should
each
have
a
draw
out
of
one
of
these
boxes,
while
I
ate
the
pill
that
remained.
It
would
be
quite
as
deadly,
and
a
good
deal
less
noisy
than
firing
across
a
handkerchief.
From
that
day
I
had
always
my
pill
boxes
about
with
me,
and
the
time
had
now
come
when
I
was
to
use
them.

“It
was
nearer
one
than
twelve,
and
a
wild,
bleak
night,
blowing
hard
and
raining
in
torrents.
Dismal
as
it
was
outside,
I
was
glad
within—so
glad
that
I
could
have
shouted
out
from
pure
exultation.
If
any
of
you
gentlemen
have
ever
pined
for
a
thing,
and
longed
for
it
during
twenty
long
years,
and
then
suddenly
found
it
within
your
reach,
you
would
understand
my
feelings.
I
lit
a
cigar,
and
puffed
at
it
to
steady
my
nerves,
but
my
hands
were
trembling,
and
my
temples
throbbing
with
excitement.
As
I
drove,
I
could
see
old
John
Ferrier
and
sweet
Lucy
looking
at
me
out
of
the
darkness
and
smiling
at
me,
just
as
plain
as
I
see
you
all
in
this
room.
All
the
way
they
were
ahead
of
me,
one
on
each
side
of
the
horse
until
I
pulled
up
at
the
house
in
the
Brixton
Road.

“There
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen,
nor
a
sound
to
be
heard,
except
the
dripping
of
the
rain.
When
I
looked
in
at
the
window,
I
found
Drebber
all
huddled
together
in
a
drunken
sleep.
I
shook
him
by
the
arm,
‘It’s
time
to
get
out,’
I
said.

“‘All
right,
cabby,’
said
he.

“I
suppose
he
thought
we
had
come
to
the
hotel
that
he
had
mentioned,
for
he
got
out
without
another
word,
and
followed
me
down
the
garden.
I
had
to
walk
beside
him
to
keep
him
steady,
for
he
was
still
a
little
top-heavy.
When
we
came
to
the
door,
I
opened
it,
and
led
him
into
the
front
room.
I
give
you
my
word
that
all
the
way,
the
father
and
the
daughter
were
walking
in
front
of
us.

“‘It’s
infernally
dark,’
said
he,
stamping
about.

“‘We’ll
soon
have
a
light,’
I
said,
striking
a
match
and
putting
it
to
a
wax
candle
which
I
had
brought
with
me.
‘Now,
Enoch
Drebber,’
I
continued,
turning
to
him,
and
holding
the
light
to
my
own
face,
‘who
am
I?’

“He
gazed
at
me
with
bleared,
drunken
eyes
for
a
moment,
and
then
I
saw
a
horror
spring
up
in
them,
and
convulse
his
whole
features,
which
showed
me
that
he
knew
me.
He
staggered
back
with
a
livid
face,
and
I
saw
the
perspiration
break
out
upon
his
brow,
while
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head.
At
the
sight,
I
leaned
my
back
against
the
door
and
laughed
loud
and
long.
I
had
always
known
that
vengeance
would
be
sweet,
but
I
had
never
hoped
for
the
contentment
of
soul
which
now
possessed
me.

“‘You
dog!’
I
said;
‘I
have
hunted
you
from
Salt
Lake
City
to
St.
Petersburg,
and
you
have
always
escaped
me.
Now,
at
last
your
wanderings
have
come
to
an
end,
for
either
you
or
I
shall
never
see
to-morrow’s
sun
rise.’
He
shrunk
still
further
away
as
I
spoke,
and
I
could
see
on
his
face
that
he
thought
I
was
mad.
So
I
was
for
the
time.
The
pulses
in
my
temples
beat
like
sledge-hammers,
and
I
believe
I
would
have
had
a
fit
of
some
sort
if
the
blood
had
not
gushed
from
my
nose
and
relieved
me.

“‘What
do
you
think
of
Lucy
Ferrier
now?’
I
cried,
locking
the
door,
and
shaking
the
key
in
his
face.
‘Punishment
has
been
slow
in
coming,
but
it
has
overtaken
you
at
last.’
I
saw
his
coward
lips
tremble
as
I
spoke.
He
would
have
begged
for
his
life,
but
he
knew
well
that
it
was
useless.

“‘Would
you
murder
me?’
he
stammered.

“‘There
is
no
murder,’
I
answered.
‘Who
talks
of
murdering
a
mad
dog?
What
mercy
had
you
upon
my
poor
darling,
when
you
dragged
her
from
her
slaughtered
father,
and
bore
her
away
to
your
accursed
and
shameless
harem.’

“‘It
was
not
I
who
killed
her
father,’
he
cried.

“‘But
it
was
you
who
broke
her
innocent
heart,’
I
shrieked,
thrusting
the
box
before
him.
‘Let
the
high
God
judge
between
us.
Choose
and
eat.
There
is
death
in
one
and
life
in
the
other.
I
shall
take
what
you
leave.
Let
us
see
if
there
is
justice
upon
the
earth,
or
if
we
are
ruled
by
chance.’

“He
cowered
away
with
wild
cries
and
prayers
for
mercy,
but
I
drew
my
knife
and
held
it
to
his
throat
until
he
had
obeyed
me.
Then
I
swallowed
the
other,
and
we
stood
facing
one
another
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
more,
waiting
to
see
which
was
to
live
and
which
was
to
die.
Shall
I
ever
forget
the
look
which
came
over
his
face
when
the
first
warning
pangs
told
him
that
the
poison
was
in
his
system?
I
laughed
as
I
saw
it,
and
held
Lucy’s
marriage
ring
in
front
of
his
eyes.
It
was
but
for
a
moment,
for
the
action
of
the
alkaloid
is
rapid.
A
spasm
of
pain
contorted
his
features;
he
threw
his
hands
out
in
front
of
him,
staggered,
and
then,
with
a
hoarse
cry,
fell
heavily
upon
the
floor.
I
turned
him
over
with
my
foot,
and
placed
my
hand
upon
his
heart.
There
was
no
movement.
He
was
dead!

“The
blood
had
been
streaming
from
my
nose,
but
I
had
taken
no
notice
of
it.
I
don’t
know
what
it
was
that
put
it
into
my
head
to
write
upon
the
wall
with
it.
Perhaps
it
was
some
mischievous
idea
of
setting
the
police
upon
a
wrong
track,
for
I
felt
light-hearted
and
cheerful.
I
remembered
a
German
being
found
in
New
York
with
RACHE
written
up
above
him,
and
it
was
argued
at
the
time
in
the
newspapers
that
the
secret
societies
must
have
done
it.
I
guessed
that
what
puzzled
the
New
Yorkers
would
puzzle
the
Londoners,
so
I
dipped
my
finger
in
my
own
blood
and
printed
it
on
a
convenient
place
on
the
wall.
Then
I
walked
down
to
my
cab
and
found
that
there
was
nobody
about,
and
that
the
night
was
still
very
wild.
I
had
driven
some
distance
when
I
put
my
hand
into
the
pocket
in
which
I
usually
kept
Lucy’s
ring,
and
found
that
it
was
not
there.
I
was
thunderstruck
at
this,
for
it
was
the
only
memento
that
I
had
of
her.
Thinking
that
I
might
have
dropped
it
when
I
stooped
over
Drebber’s
body,
I
drove
back,
and
leaving
my
cab
in
a
side
street,
I
went
boldly
up
to
the
house—for
I
was
ready
to
dare
anything
rather
than
lose
the
ring.
When
I
arrived
there,
I
walked
right
into
the
arms
of
a
police-officer
who
was
coming
out,
and
only
managed
to
disarm
his
suspicions
by
pretending
to
be
hopelessly
drunk.

“That
was
how
Enoch
Drebber
came
to
his
end.
All
I
had
to
do
then
was
to
do
as
much
for
Stangerson,
and
so
pay
off
John
Ferrier’s
debt.
I
knew
that
he
was
staying
at
Halliday’s
Private
Hotel,
and
I
hung
about
all
day,
but
he
never
came
out.
26
fancy
that
he
suspected
something
when
Drebber
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance.
He
was
cunning,
was
Stangerson,
and
always
on
his
guard.
If
he
thought
he
could
keep
me
off
by
staying
indoors
he
was
very
much
mistaken.
I
soon
found
out
which
was
the
window
of
his
bedroom,
and
early
next
morning
I
took
advantage
of
some
ladders
which
were
lying
in
the
lane
behind
the
hotel,
and
so
made
my
way
into
his
room
in
the
grey
of
the
dawn.
I
woke
him
up
and
told
him
that
the
hour
had
come
when
he
was
to
answer
for
the
life
he
had
taken
so
long
before.
I
described
Drebber’s
death
to
him,
and
I
gave
him
the
same
choice
of
the
poisoned
pills.
Instead
of
grasping
at
the
chance
of
safety
which
that
offered
him,
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
flew
at
my
throat.
In
self-defence
I
stabbed
him
to
the
heart.
It
would
have
been
the
same
in
any
case,
for
Providence
would
never
have
allowed
his
guilty
hand
to
pick
out
anything
but
the
poison.

“I
have
little
more
to
say,
and
it’s
as
well,
for
I
am
about
done
up.
I
went
on
cabbing
it
for
a
day
or
so,
intending
to
keep
at
it
until
I
could
save
enough
to
take
me
back
to
America.
I
was
standing
in
the
yard
when
a
ragged
youngster
asked
if
there
was
a
cabby
there
called
Jefferson
Hope,
and
said
that
his
cab
was
wanted
by
a
gentleman
at
221B,
Baker
Street.
I
went
round,
suspecting
no
harm,
and
the
next
thing
I
knew,
this
young
man
here
had
the
bracelets
on
my
wrists,
and
as
neatly
snackled
27
as
ever
I
saw
in
my
life.
That’s
the
whole
of
my
story,
gentlemen.
You
may
consider
me
to
be
a
murderer;
but
I
hold
that
I
am
just
as
much
an
officer
of
justice
as
you
are.”

So
thrilling
had
the
man’s
narrative
been,
and
his
manner
was
so
impressive
that
we
had
sat
silent
and
absorbed.
Even
the
professional
detectives,
blasé
as
they
were
in
every
detail
of
crime,
appeared
to
be
keenly
interested
in
the
man’s
story.
When
he
finished
we
sat
for
some
minutes
in
a
stillness
which
was
only
broken
by
the
scratching
of
Lestrade’s
pencil
as
he
gave
the
finishing
touches
to
his
shorthand
account.

“There
is
only
one
point
on
which
I
should
like
a
little
more
information,”
Sherlock
Holmes
said
at
last.
“Who
was
your
accomplice
who
came
for
the
ring
which
I
advertised?”

The
prisoner
winked
at
my
friend
jocosely.
“I
can
tell
my
own
secrets,”
he
said,
“but
I
don’t
get
other
people
into
trouble.
I
saw
your
advertisement,
and
I
thought
it
might
be
a
plant,
or
it
might
be
the
ring
which
I
wanted.
My
friend
volunteered
to
go
and
see.
I
think
you’ll
own
he
did
it
smartly.”

“Not
a
doubt
of
that,”
said
Holmes
heartily.

“Now,
gentlemen,”
the
Inspector
remarked
gravely,
“the
forms
of
the
law
must
be
complied
with.
On
Thursday
the
prisoner
will
be
brought
before
the
magistrates,
and
your
attendance
will
be
required.
Until
then
I
will
be
responsible
for
him.”
He
rang
the
bell
as
he
spoke,
and
Jefferson
Hope
was
led
off
by
a
couple
of
warders,
while
my
friend
and
I
made
our
way
out
of
the
Station
and
took
a
cab
back
to
Baker
Street.





CHAPTER
VII.
THE
CONCLUSION.

WE
had
all
been
warned
to
appear
before
the
magistrates
upon
the
Thursday;
but
when
the
Thursday
came
there
was
no
occasion
for
our
testimony.
A
higher
Judge
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand,
and
Jefferson
Hope
had
been
summoned
before
a
tribunal
where
strict
justice
would
be
meted
out
to
him.
On
the
very
night
after
his
capture
the
aneurism
burst,
and
he
was
found
in
the
morning
stretched
upon
the
floor
of
the
cell,
with
a
placid
smile
upon
his
face,
as
though
he
had
been
able
in
his
dying
moments
to
look
back
upon
a
useful
life,
and
on
work
well
done.

“Gregson
and
Lestrade
will
be
wild
about
his
death,”
Holmes
remarked,
as
we
chatted
it
over
next
evening.
“Where
will
their
grand
advertisement
be
now?”

“I
don’t
see
that
they
had
very
much
to
do
with
his
capture,”
I
answered.

“What
you
do
in
this
world
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence,”
returned
my
companion,
bitterly.
“The
question
is,
what
can
you
make
people
believe
that
you
have
done.
Never
mind,”
he
continued,
more
brightly,
after
a
pause.
“I
would
not
have
missed
the
investigation
for
anything.
There
has
been
no
better
case
within
my
recollection.
Simple
as
it
was,
there
were
several
most
instructive
points
about
it.”

“Simple!”
I
ejaculated.

“Well,
really,
it
can
hardly
be
described
as
otherwise,”
said
Sherlock
Holmes,
smiling
at
my
surprise.
“The
proof
of
its
intrinsic
simplicity
is,
that
without
any
help
save
a
few
very
ordinary
deductions
I
was
able
to
lay
my
hand
upon
the
criminal
within
three
days.”

“That
is
true,”
said
I.

“I
have
already
explained
to
you
that
what
is
out
of
the
common
is
usually
a
guide
rather
than
a
hindrance.
In
solving
a
problem
of
this
sort,
the
grand
thing
is
to
be
able
to
reason
backwards.
That
is
a
very
useful
accomplishment,
and
a
very
easy
one,
but
people
do
not
practise
it
much.
In
the
every-day
affairs
of
life
it
is
more
useful
to
reason
forwards,
and
so
the
other
comes
to
be
neglected.
There
are
fifty
who
can
reason
synthetically
for
one
who
can
reason
analytically.”

“I
confess,”
said
I,
“that
I
do
not
quite
follow
you.”

“I
hardly
expected
that
you
would.
Let
me
see
if
I
can
make
it
clearer.
Most
people,
if
you
describe
a
train
of
events
to
them,
will
tell
you
what
the
result
would
be.
They
can
put
those
events
together
in
their
minds,
and
argue
from
them
that
something
will
come
to
pass.
There
are
few
people,
however,
who,
if
you
told
them
a
result,
would
be
able
to
evolve
from
their
own
inner
consciousness
what
the
steps
were
which
led
up
to
that
result.
This
power
is
what
I
mean
when
I
talk
of
reasoning
backwards,
or
analytically.”

“I
understand,”
said
I.

“Now
this
was
a
case
in
which
you
were
given
the
result
and
had
to
find
everything
else
for
yourself.
Now
let
me
endeavour
to
show
you
the
different
steps
in
my
reasoning.
To
begin
at
the
beginning.
I
approached
the
house,
as
you
know,
on
foot,
and
with
my
mind
entirely
free
from
all
impressions.
I
naturally
began
by
examining
the
roadway,
and
there,
as
I
have
already
explained
to
you,
I
saw
clearly
the
marks
of
a
cab,
which,
I
ascertained
by
inquiry,
must
have
been
there
during
the
night.
I
satisfied
myself
that
it
was
a
cab
and
not
a
private
carriage
by
the
narrow
gauge
of
the
wheels.
The
ordinary
London
growler
is
considerably
less
wide
than
a
gentleman’s
brougham.

“This
was
the
first
point
gained.
I
then
walked
slowly
down
the
garden
path,
which
happened
to
be
composed
of
a
clay
soil,
peculiarly
suitable
for
taking
impressions.
No
doubt
it
appeared
to
you
to
be
a
mere
trampled
line
of
slush,
but
to
my
trained
eyes
every
mark
upon
its
surface
had
a
meaning.
There
is
no
branch
of
detective
science
which
is
so
important
and
so
much
neglected
as
the
art
of
tracing
footsteps.
Happily,
I
have
always
laid
great
stress
upon
it,
and
much
practice
has
made
it
second
nature
to
me.
I
saw
the
heavy
footmarks
of
the
constables,
but
I
saw
also
the
track
of
the
two
men
who
had
first
passed
through
the
garden.
It
was
easy
to
tell
that
they
had
been
before
the
others,
because
in
places
their
marks
had
been
entirely
obliterated
by
the
others
coming
upon
the
top
of
them.
In
this
way
my
second
link
was
formed,
which
told
me
that
the
nocturnal
visitors
were
two
in
number,
one
remarkable
for
his
height
(as
I
calculated
from
the
length
of
his
stride),
and
the
other
fashionably
dressed,
to
judge
from
the
small
and
elegant
impression
left
by
his
boots.

“On
entering
the
house
this
last
inference
was
confirmed.
My
well-booted
man
lay
before
me.
The
tall
one,
then,
had
done
the
murder,
if
murder
there
was.
There
was
no
wound
upon
the
dead
man’s
person,
but
the
agitated
expression
upon
his
face
assured
me
that
he
had
foreseen
his
fate
before
it
came
upon
him.
Men
who
die
from
heart
disease,
or
any
sudden
natural
cause,
never
by
any
chance
exhibit
agitation
upon
their
features.
Having
sniffed
the
dead
man’s
lips
I
detected
a
slightly
sour
smell,
and
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
had
poison
forced
upon
him.
Again,
I
argued
that
it
had
been
forced
upon
him
from
the
hatred
and
fear
expressed
upon
his
face.
By
the
method
of
exclusion,
I
had
arrived
at
this
result,
for
no
other
hypothesis
would
meet
the
facts.
Do
not
imagine
that
it
was
a
very
unheard
of
idea.
The
forcible
administration
of
poison
is
by
no
means
a
new
thing
in
criminal
annals.
The
cases
of
Dolsky
in
Odessa,
and
of
Leturier
in
Montpellier,
will
occur
at
once
to
any
toxicologist.

“And
now
came
the
great
question
as
to
the
reason
why.
Robbery
had
not
been
the
object
of
the
murder,
for
nothing
was
taken.
Was
it
politics,
then,
or
was
it
a
woman?
That
was
the
question
which
confronted
me.
I
was
inclined
from
the
first
to
the
latter
supposition.
Political
assassins
are
only
too
glad
to
do
their
work
and
to
fly.
This
murder
had,
on
the
contrary,
been
done
most
deliberately,
and
the
perpetrator
had
left
his
tracks
all
over
the
room,
showing
that
he
had
been
there
all
the
time.
It
must
have
been
a
private
wrong,
and
not
a
political
one,
which
called
for
such
a
methodical
revenge.
When
the
inscription
was
discovered
upon
the
wall
I
was
more
inclined
than
ever
to
my
opinion.
The
thing
was
too
evidently
a
blind.
When
the
ring
was
found,
however,
it
settled
the
question.
Clearly
the
murderer
had
used
it
to
remind
his
victim
of
some
dead
or
absent
woman.
It
was
at
this
point
that
I
asked
Gregson
whether
he
had
enquired
in
his
telegram
to
Cleveland
as
to
any
particular
point
in
Mr.
Drebber’s
former
career.
He
answered,
you
remember,
in
the
negative.

“I
then
proceeded
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
room,
which
confirmed
me
in
my
opinion
as
to
the
murderer’s
height,
and
furnished
me
with
the
additional
details
as
to
the
Trichinopoly
cigar
and
the
length
of
his
nails.
I
had
already
come
to
the
conclusion,
since
there
were
no
signs
of
a
struggle,
that
the
blood
which
covered
the
floor
had
burst
from
the
murderer’s
nose
in
his
excitement.
I
could
perceive
that
the
track
of
blood
coincided
with
the
track
of
his
feet.
It
is
seldom
that
any
man,
unless
he
is
very
full-blooded,
breaks
out
in
this
way
through
emotion,
so
I
hazarded
the
opinion
that
the
criminal
was
probably
a
robust
and
ruddy-faced
man.
Events
proved
that
I
had
judged
correctly.

“Having
left
the
house,
I
proceeded
to
do
what
Gregson
had
neglected.
I
telegraphed
to
the
head
of
the
police
at
Cleveland,
limiting
my
enquiry
to
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
marriage
of
Enoch
Drebber.
The
answer
was
conclusive.
It
told
me
that
Drebber
had
already
applied
for
the
protection
of
the
law
against
an
old
rival
in
love,
named
Jefferson
Hope,
and
that
this
same
Hope
was
at
present
in
Europe.
I
knew
now
that
I
held
the
clue
to
the
mystery
in
my
hand,
and
all
that
remained
was
to
secure
the
murderer.

“I
had
already
determined
in
my
own
mind
that
the
man
who
had
walked
into
the
house
with
Drebber,
was
none
other
than
the
man
who
had
driven
the
cab.
The
marks
in
the
road
showed
me
that
the
horse
had
wandered
on
in
a
way
which
would
have
been
impossible
had
there
been
anyone
in
charge
of
it.
Where,
then,
could
the
driver
be,
unless
he
were
inside
the
house?
Again,
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
any
sane
man
would
carry
out
a
deliberate
crime
under
the
very
eyes,
as
it
were,
of
a
third
person,
who
was
sure
to
betray
him.
Lastly,
supposing
one
man
wished
to
dog
another
through
London,
what
better
means
could
he
adopt
than
to
turn
cabdriver.
All
these
considerations
led
me
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
Jefferson
Hope
was
to
be
found
among
the
jarveys
of
the
Metropolis.

“If
he
had
been
one
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
ceased
to
be.
On
the
contrary,
from
his
point
of
view,
any
sudden
change
would
be
likely
to
draw
attention
to
himself.
He
would,
probably,
for
a
time
at
least,
continue
to
perform
his
duties.
There
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
was
going
under
an
assumed
name.
Why
should
he
change
his
name
in
a
country
where
no
one
knew
his
original
one?
I
therefore
organized
my
Street
Arab
detective
corps,
and
sent
them
systematically
to
every
cab
proprietor
in
London
until
they
ferreted
out
the
man
that
I
wanted.
How
well
they
succeeded,
and
how
quickly
I
took
advantage
of
it,
are
still
fresh
in
your
recollection.
The
murder
of
Stangerson
was
an
incident
which
was
entirely
unexpected,
but
which
could
hardly
in
any
case
have
been
prevented.
Through
it,
as
you
know,
I
came
into
possession
of
the
pills,
the
existence
of
which
I
had
already
surmised.
You
see
the
whole
thing
is
a
chain
of
logical
sequences
without
a
break
or
flaw.”

“It
is
wonderful!”
I
cried.
“Your
merits
should
be
publicly
recognized.
You
should
publish
an
account
of
the
case.
If
you
won’t,
I
will
for
you.”

“You
may
do
what
you
like,
Doctor,”
he
answered.
“See
here!”
he
continued,
handing
a
paper
over
to
me,
“look
at
this!”

It
was
the
Echo
for
the
day,
and
the
paragraph
to
which
he
pointed
was
devoted
to
the
case
in
question.

“The
public,”
it
said,
“have
lost
a
sensational
treat
through
the
sudden
death
of
the
man
Hope,
who
was
suspected
of
the
murder
of
Mr.
Enoch
Drebber
and
of
Mr.
Joseph
Stangerson.
The
details
of
the
case
will
probably
be
never
known
now,
though
we
are
informed
upon
good
authority
that
the
crime
was
the
result
of
an
old
standing
and
romantic
feud,
in
which
love
and
Mormonism
bore
a
part.
It
seems
that
both
the
victims
belonged,
in
their
younger
days,
to
the
Latter
Day
Saints,
and
Hope,
the
deceased
prisoner,
hails
also
from
Salt
Lake
City.
If
the
case
has
had
no
other
effect,
it,
at
least,
brings
out
in
the
most
striking
manner
the
efficiency
of
our
detective
police
force,
and
will
serve
as
a
lesson
to
all
foreigners
that
they
will
do
wisely
to
settle
their
feuds
at
home,
and
not
to
carry
them
on
to
British
soil.
It
is
an
open
secret
that
the
credit
of
this
smart
capture
belongs
entirely
to
the
well-known
Scotland
Yard
officials,
Messrs.
Lestrade
and
Gregson.
The
man
was
apprehended,
it
appears,
in
the
rooms
of
a
certain
Mr.
Sherlock
Holmes,
who
has
himself,
as
an
amateur,
shown
some
talent
in
the
detective
line,
and
who,
with
such
instructors,
may
hope
in
time
to
attain
to
some
degree
of
their
skill.
It
is
expected
that
a
testimonial
of
some
sort
will
be
presented
to
the
two
officers
as
a
fitting
recognition
of
their
services.”

“Didn’t
I
tell
you
so
when
we
started?”
cried
Sherlock
Holmes
with
a
laugh.
“That’s
the
result
of
all
our
Study
in
Scarlet:
to
get
them
a
testimonial!”

“Never
mind,”
I
answered,
“I
have
all
the
facts
in
my
journal,
and
the
public
shall
know
them.
In
the
meantime
you
must
make
yourself
contented
by
the
consciousness
of
success,
like
the
Roman
miser—

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
I.
ADD
MR.
ADD
SHERLOCK
ADD
HOLMES.
ADD

ADD
IN
ADD
the
ADD
year
ADD
1878
ADD
I
ADD
took
ADD
my
ADD
degree
ADD
of
ADD
Doctor
ADD
of
ADD
Medicine
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
University
ADD
of
ADD
London,
ADD
and
ADD
proceeded
ADD
to
ADD
Netley
ADD
to
ADD
go
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
course
ADD
prescribed
ADD
for
ADD
surgeons
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
army.
ADD
Having
ADD
completed
ADD
my
ADD
studies
ADD
there,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
duly
ADD
attached
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Fifth
ADD
Northumberland
ADD
Fusiliers
ADD
as
ADD
Assistant
ADD
Surgeon.
ADD
The
ADD
regiment
ADD
was
ADD
stationed
ADD
in
ADD
India
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
time,
ADD
and
ADD
before
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
join
ADD
it,
ADD
the
ADD
second
ADD
Afghan
ADD
war
ADD
had
ADD
broken
ADD
out.
ADD
On
ADD
landing
ADD
at
ADD
Bombay,
ADD
I
ADD
learned
ADD
that
ADD
my
ADD
corps
ADD
had
ADD
advanced
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
passes,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
already
ADD
deep
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
enemy’s
ADD
country.
ADD
I
ADD
followed,
ADD
however,
ADD
with
ADD
many
ADD
other
ADD
officers
ADD
who
ADD
were
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
situation
ADD
as
ADD
myself,
ADD
and
ADD
succeeded
ADD
in
ADD
reaching
ADD
Candahar
ADD
in
ADD
safety,
ADD
where
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
my
ADD
regiment,
ADD
and
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
entered
ADD
upon
ADD
my
ADD
new
ADD
duties.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
campaign
ADD
brought
ADD
honours
ADD
and
ADD
promotion
ADD
to
ADD
many,
ADD
but
ADD
for
ADD
me
ADD
it
ADD
had
ADD
nothing
ADD
but
ADD
misfortune
ADD
and
ADD
disaster.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
removed
ADD
from
ADD
my
ADD
brigade
ADD
and
ADD
attached
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Berkshires,
ADD
with
ADD
whom
ADD
I
ADD
served
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
fatal
ADD
battle
ADD
of
ADD
Maiwand.
ADD
There
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
struck
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
shoulder
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
Jezail
ADD
bullet,
ADD
which
ADD
shattered
ADD
the
ADD
bone
ADD
and
ADD
grazed
ADD
the
ADD
subclavian
ADD
artery.
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
have
ADD
fallen
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
hands
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
murderous
ADD
Ghazis
ADD
had
ADD
it
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
devotion
ADD
and
ADD
courage
ADD
shown
ADD
by
ADD
Murray,
ADD
my
ADD
orderly,
ADD
who
ADD
threw
ADD
me
ADD
across
ADD
a
ADD
pack-horse,
ADD
and
ADD
succeeded
ADD
in
ADD
bringing
ADD
me
ADD
safely
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
British
ADD
lines.
ADD

ADD
Worn
ADD
with
ADD
pain,
ADD
and
ADD
weak
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
prolonged
ADD
hardships
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
undergone,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
removed,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
train
ADD
of
ADD
wounded
ADD
sufferers,
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
base
ADD
hospital
ADD
at
ADD
Peshawar.
ADD
Here
ADD
I
ADD
rallied,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
improved
ADD
so
ADD
far
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
walk
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
wards,
ADD
and
ADD
even
ADD
to
ADD
bask
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
verandah,
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
struck
ADD
down
ADD
by
ADD
enteric
ADD
fever,
ADD
that
ADD
curse
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
Indian
ADD
possessions.
ADD
For
ADD
months
ADD
my
ADD
life
ADD
was
ADD
despaired
ADD
of,
ADD
and
ADD
when
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
I
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
myself
ADD
and
ADD
became
ADD
convalescent,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
weak
ADD
and
ADD
emaciated
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
medical
ADD
board
ADD
determined
ADD
that
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
day
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
lost
ADD
in
ADD
sending
ADD
me
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
England.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
dispatched,
ADD
accordingly,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
troopship
ADD
“Orontes,”
ADD
and
ADD
landed
ADD
a
ADD
month
ADD
later
ADD
on
ADD
Portsmouth
ADD
jetty,
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
health
ADD
irretrievably
ADD
ruined,
ADD
but
ADD
with
ADD
permission
ADD
from
ADD
a
ADD
paternal
ADD
government
ADD
to
ADD
spend
ADD
the
ADD
next
ADD
nine
ADD
months
ADD
in
ADD
attempting
ADD
to
ADD
improve
ADD
it.
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
neither
ADD
kith
ADD
nor
ADD
kin
ADD
in
ADD
England,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
therefore
ADD
as
ADD
free
ADD
as
ADD
air—or
ADD
as
ADD
free
ADD
as
ADD
an
ADD
income
ADD
of
ADD
eleven
ADD
shillings
ADD
and
ADD
sixpence
ADD
a
ADD
day
ADD
will
ADD
permit
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
to
ADD
be.
ADD
Under
ADD
such
ADD
circumstances,
ADD
I
ADD
naturally
ADD
gravitated
ADD
to
ADD
London,
ADD
that
ADD
great
ADD
cesspool
ADD
into
ADD
which
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
loungers
ADD
and
ADD
idlers
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Empire
ADD
are
ADD
irresistibly
ADD
drained.
ADD
There
ADD
I
ADD
stayed
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
time
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
private
ADD
hotel
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Strand,
ADD
leading
ADD
a
ADD
comfortless,
ADD
meaningless
ADD
existence,
ADD
and
ADD
spending
ADD
such
ADD
money
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
had,
ADD
considerably
ADD
more
ADD
freely
ADD
than
ADD
I
ADD
ought.
ADD
So
ADD
alarming
ADD
did
ADD
the
ADD
state
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
finances
ADD
become,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
soon
ADD
realized
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
must
ADD
either
ADD
leave
ADD
the
ADD
metropolis
ADD
and
ADD
rusticate
ADD
somewhere
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
country,
ADD
or
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
must
ADD
make
ADD
a
ADD
complete
ADD
alteration
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
style
ADD
of
ADD
living.
ADD
Choosing
ADD
the
ADD
latter
ADD
alternative,
ADD
I
ADD
began
ADD
by
ADD
making
ADD
up
ADD
my
ADD
mind
ADD
to
ADD
leave
ADD
the
ADD
hotel,
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
up
ADD
my
ADD
quarters
ADD
in
ADD
some
ADD
less
ADD
pretentious
ADD
and
ADD
less
ADD
expensive
ADD
domicile.
ADD

ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
day
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
conclusion,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
standing
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
Criterion
ADD
Bar,
ADD
when
ADD
some
ADD
one
ADD
tapped
ADD
me
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
shoulder,
ADD
and
ADD
turning
ADD
round
ADD
I
ADD
recognized
ADD
young
ADD
Stamford,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
dresser
ADD
under
ADD
me
ADD
at
ADD
Barts.
ADD
The
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
friendly
ADD
face
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
wilderness
ADD
of
ADD
London
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
pleasant
ADD
thing
ADD
indeed
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
lonely
ADD
man.
ADD
In
ADD
old
ADD
days
ADD
Stamford
ADD
had
ADD
never
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
particular
ADD
crony
ADD
of
ADD
mine,
ADD
but
ADD
now
ADD
I
ADD
hailed
ADD
him
ADD
with
ADD
enthusiasm,
ADD
and
ADD
he,
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
turn,
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
delighted
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
me.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
exuberance
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
joy,
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
lunch
ADD
with
ADD
me
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
Holborn,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
started
ADD
off
ADD
together
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
hansom.
ADD

ADD
“Whatever
ADD
have
ADD
you
ADD
been
ADD
doing
ADD
with
ADD
yourself,
ADD
Watson?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked
ADD
in
ADD
undisguised
ADD
wonder,
ADD
as
ADD
we
ADD
rattled
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
crowded
ADD
London
ADD
streets.
ADD
“You
ADD
are
ADD
as
ADD
thin
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
lath
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
brown
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
nut.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
gave
ADD
him
ADD
a
ADD
short
ADD
sketch
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
adventures,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
hardly
ADD
concluded
ADD
it
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
reached
ADD
our
ADD
destination.
ADD

ADD
“Poor
ADD
devil!”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
commiseratingly,
ADD
after
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
listened
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
misfortunes.
ADD
“What
ADD
are
ADD
you
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
now?”
ADD

ADD
“Looking
ADD
for
ADD
lodgings.”
ADD
3
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD
“Trying
ADD
to
ADD
solve
ADD
the
ADD
problem
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
whether
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
possible
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
comfortable
ADD
rooms
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
reasonable
ADD
price.”
ADD

ADD
“That’s
ADD
a
ADD
strange
ADD
thing,”
ADD
remarked
ADD
my
ADD
companion;
ADD
“you
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
second
ADD
man
ADD
to-day
ADD
that
ADD
has
ADD
used
ADD
that
ADD
expression
ADD
to
ADD
me.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
first?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“A
ADD
fellow
ADD
who
ADD
is
ADD
working
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
chemical
ADD
laboratory
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
hospital.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
bemoaning
ADD
himself
ADD
this
ADD
morning
ADD
because
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
get
ADD
someone
ADD
to
ADD
go
ADD
halves
ADD
with
ADD
him
ADD
in
ADD
some
ADD
nice
ADD
rooms
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
found,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
too
ADD
much
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
purse.”
ADD

ADD
“By
ADD
Jove!”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
“if
ADD
he
ADD
really
ADD
wants
ADD
someone
ADD
to
ADD
share
ADD
the
ADD
rooms
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
expense,
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
man
ADD
for
ADD
him.
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
prefer
ADD
having
ADD
a
ADD
partner
ADD
to
ADD
being
ADD
alone.”
ADD

ADD
Young
ADD
Stamford
ADD
looked
ADD
rather
ADD
strangely
ADD
at
ADD
me
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
wine-glass.
ADD
“You
ADD
don’t
ADD
know
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
yet,”
ADD
he
ADD
said;
ADD
“perhaps
ADD
you
ADD
would
ADD
not
ADD
care
ADD
for
ADD
him
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
constant
ADD
companion.”
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
what
ADD
is
ADD
there
ADD
against
ADD
him?”
ADD

ADD
“Oh,
ADD
I
ADD
didn’t
ADD
say
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
anything
ADD
against
ADD
him.
ADD
He
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
queer
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
ideas—an
ADD
enthusiast
ADD
in
ADD
some
ADD
branches
ADD
of
ADD
science.
ADD
As
ADD
far
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
know
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
decent
ADD
fellow
ADD
enough.”
ADD

ADD
“A
ADD
medical
ADD
student,
ADD
I
ADD
suppose?”
ADD
said
ADD
I.
ADD

ADD
“No—I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
idea
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
intends
ADD
to
ADD
go
ADD
in
ADD
for.
ADD
I
ADD
believe
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
well
ADD
up
ADD
in
ADD
anatomy,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
first-class
ADD
chemist;
ADD
but,
ADD
as
ADD
far
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
know,
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
never
ADD
taken
ADD
out
ADD
any
ADD
systematic
ADD
medical
ADD
classes.
ADD
His
ADD
studies
ADD
are
ADD
very
ADD
desultory
ADD
and
ADD
eccentric,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
amassed
ADD
a
ADD
lot
ADD
of
ADD
out-of-the
ADD
way
ADD
knowledge
ADD
which
ADD
would
ADD
astonish
ADD
his
ADD
professors.”
ADD

ADD
“Did
ADD
you
ADD
never
ADD
ask
ADD
him
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
going
ADD
in
ADD
for?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“No;
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
easy
ADD
to
ADD
draw
ADD
out,
ADD
though
ADD
he
ADD
can
ADD
be
ADD
communicative
ADD
enough
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
fancy
ADD
seizes
ADD
him.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
should
ADD
like
ADD
to
ADD
meet
ADD
him,”
ADD
I
ADD
said.
ADD
“If
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
to
ADD
lodge
ADD
with
ADD
anyone,
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
prefer
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
of
ADD
studious
ADD
and
ADD
quiet
ADD
habits.
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
not
ADD
strong
ADD
enough
ADD
yet
ADD
to
ADD
stand
ADD
much
ADD
noise
ADD
or
ADD
excitement.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
enough
ADD
of
ADD
both
ADD
in
ADD
Afghanistan
ADD
to
ADD
last
ADD
me
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
remainder
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
natural
ADD
existence.
ADD
How
ADD
could
ADD
I
ADD
meet
ADD
this
ADD
friend
ADD
of
ADD
yours?”
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
is
ADD
sure
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
laboratory,”
ADD
returned
ADD
my
ADD
companion.
ADD
“He
ADD
either
ADD
avoids
ADD
the
ADD
place
ADD
for
ADD
weeks,
ADD
or
ADD
else
ADD
he
ADD
works
ADD
there
ADD
from
ADD
morning
ADD
to
ADD
night.
ADD
If
ADD
you
ADD
like,
ADD
we
ADD
shall
ADD
drive
ADD
round
ADD
together
ADD
after
ADD
luncheon.”
ADD

ADD
“Certainly,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
conversation
ADD
drifted
ADD
away
ADD
into
ADD
other
ADD
channels.
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
we
ADD
made
ADD
our
ADD
way
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
hospital
ADD
after
ADD
leaving
ADD
the
ADD
Holborn,
ADD
Stamford
ADD
gave
ADD
me
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
more
ADD
particulars
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
gentleman
ADD
whom
ADD
I
ADD
proposed
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
fellow-lodger.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
mustn’t
ADD
blame
ADD
me
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
don’t
ADD
get
ADD
on
ADD
with
ADD
him,”
ADD
he
ADD
said;
ADD
“I
ADD
know
ADD
nothing
ADD
more
ADD
of
ADD
him
ADD
than
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
learned
ADD
from
ADD
meeting
ADD
him
ADD
occasionally
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
laboratory.
ADD
You
ADD
proposed
ADD
this
ADD
arrangement,
ADD
so
ADD
you
ADD
must
ADD
not
ADD
hold
ADD
me
ADD
responsible.”
ADD

ADD
“If
ADD
we
ADD
don’t
ADD
get
ADD
on
ADD
it
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
easy
ADD
to
ADD
part
ADD
company,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD
“It
ADD
seems
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
Stamford,”
ADD
I
ADD
added,
ADD
looking
ADD
hard
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
companion,
ADD
“that
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
some
ADD
reason
ADD
for
ADD
washing
ADD
your
ADD
hands
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
matter.
ADD
Is
ADD
this
ADD
fellow’s
ADD
temper
ADD
so
ADD
formidable,
ADD
or
ADD
what
ADD
is
ADD
it?
ADD
Don’t
ADD
be
ADD
mealy-mouthed
ADD
about
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
easy
ADD
to
ADD
express
ADD
the
ADD
inexpressible,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
laugh.
ADD
“Holmes
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
too
ADD
scientific
ADD
for
ADD
my
ADD
tastes—it
ADD
approaches
ADD
to
ADD
cold-bloodedness.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
imagine
ADD
his
ADD
giving
ADD
a
ADD
friend
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
pinch
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
latest
ADD
vegetable
ADD
alkaloid,
ADD
not
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
malevolence,
ADD
you
ADD
understand,
ADD
but
ADD
simply
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
spirit
ADD
of
ADD
inquiry
ADD
in
ADD
order
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
an
ADD
accurate
ADD
idea
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
effects.
ADD
To
ADD
do
ADD
him
ADD
justice,
ADD
I
ADD
think
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
take
ADD
it
ADD
himself
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
readiness.
ADD
He
ADD
appears
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
passion
ADD
for
ADD
definite
ADD
and
ADD
exact
ADD
knowledge.”
ADD

ADD
“Very
ADD
right
ADD
too.”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
but
ADD
it
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
pushed
ADD
to
ADD
excess.
ADD
When
ADD
it
ADD
comes
ADD
to
ADD
beating
ADD
the
ADD
subjects
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
dissecting-rooms
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
stick,
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
certainly
ADD
taking
ADD
rather
ADD
a
ADD
bizarre
ADD
shape.”
ADD

ADD
“Beating
ADD
the
ADD
subjects!”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
to
ADD
verify
ADD
how
ADD
far
ADD
bruises
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
produced
ADD
after
ADD
death.
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
him
ADD
at
ADD
it
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
eyes.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
yet
ADD
you
ADD
say
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
medical
ADD
student?”
ADD

ADD
“No.
ADD
Heaven
ADD
knows
ADD
what
ADD
the
ADD
objects
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
studies
ADD
are.
ADD
But
ADD
here
ADD
we
ADD
are,
ADD
and
ADD
you
ADD
must
ADD
form
ADD
your
ADD
own
ADD
impressions
ADD
about
ADD
him.”
ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
we
ADD
turned
ADD
down
ADD
a
ADD
narrow
ADD
lane
ADD
and
ADD
passed
ADD
through
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
side-door,
ADD
which
ADD
opened
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
wing
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
hospital.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
familiar
ADD
ground
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
needed
ADD
no
ADD
guiding
ADD
as
ADD
we
ADD
ascended
ADD
the
ADD
bleak
ADD
stone
ADD
staircase
ADD
and
ADD
made
ADD
our
ADD
way
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
long
ADD
corridor
ADD
with
ADD
its
ADD
vista
ADD
of
ADD
whitewashed
ADD
wall
ADD
and
ADD
dun-coloured
ADD
doors.
ADD
Near
ADD
the
ADD
further
ADD
end
ADD
a
ADD
low
ADD
arched
ADD
passage
ADD
branched
ADD
away
ADD
from
ADD
it
ADD
and
ADD
led
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
chemical
ADD
laboratory.
ADD

ADD
This
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
lofty
ADD
chamber,
ADD
lined
ADD
and
ADD
littered
ADD
with
ADD
countless
ADD
bottles.
ADD
Broad,
ADD
low
ADD
tables
ADD
were
ADD
scattered
ADD
about,
ADD
which
ADD
bristled
ADD
with
ADD
retorts,
ADD
test-tubes,
ADD
and
ADD
little
ADD
Bunsen
ADD
lamps,
ADD
with
ADD
their
ADD
blue
ADD
flickering
ADD
flames.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
only
ADD
one
ADD
student
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
bending
ADD
over
ADD
a
ADD
distant
ADD
table
ADD
absorbed
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
work.
ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
sound
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
steps
ADD
he
ADD
glanced
ADD
round
ADD
and
ADD
sprang
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
feet
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
cry
ADD
of
ADD
pleasure.
ADD
“I’ve
ADD
found
ADD
it!
ADD
I’ve
ADD
found
ADD
it,”
ADD
he
ADD
shouted
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
companion,
ADD
running
ADD
towards
ADD
us
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
test-tube
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
hand.
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
found
ADD
a
ADD
re-agent
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
precipitated
ADD
by
ADD
hoemoglobin,
ADD
4
ADD
and
ADD
by
ADD
nothing
ADD
else.”
ADD
Had
ADD
he
ADD
discovered
ADD
a
ADD
gold
ADD
mine,
ADD
greater
ADD
delight
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
shone
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
features.
ADD

ADD
“Dr.
ADD
Watson,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,”
ADD
said
ADD
Stamford,
ADD
introducing
ADD
us.
ADD

ADD
“How
ADD
are
ADD
you?”
ADD
he
ADD
said
ADD
cordially,
ADD
gripping
ADD
my
ADD
hand
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
strength
ADD
for
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
hardly
ADD
have
ADD
given
ADD
him
ADD
credit.
ADD
“You
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
in
ADD
Afghanistan,
ADD
I
ADD
perceive.”
ADD

ADD
“How
ADD
on
ADD
earth
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
know
ADD
that?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
in
ADD
astonishment.
ADD

ADD
“Never
ADD
mind,”
ADD
said
ADD
he,
ADD
chuckling
ADD
to
ADD
himself.
ADD
“The
ADD
question
ADD
now
ADD
is
ADD
about
ADD
hoemoglobin.
ADD
No
ADD
doubt
ADD
you
ADD
see
ADD
the
ADD
significance
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
discovery
ADD
of
ADD
mine?”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
interesting,
ADD
chemically,
ADD
no
ADD
doubt,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered,
ADD
“but
ADD
practically——”
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
man,
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
practical
ADD
medico-legal
ADD
discovery
ADD
for
ADD
years.
ADD
Don’t
ADD
you
ADD
see
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
gives
ADD
us
ADD
an
ADD
infallible
ADD
test
ADD
for
ADD
blood
ADD
stains.
ADD
Come
ADD
over
ADD
here
ADD
now!”
ADD
He
ADD
seized
ADD
me
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
coat-sleeve
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
eagerness,
ADD
and
ADD
drew
ADD
me
ADD
over
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
table
ADD
at
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
working.
ADD
“Let
ADD
us
ADD
have
ADD
some
ADD
fresh
ADD
blood,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
digging
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
bodkin
ADD
into
ADD
his
ADD
finger,
ADD
and
ADD
drawing
ADD
off
ADD
the
ADD
resulting
ADD
drop
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
chemical
ADD
pipette.
ADD
“Now,
ADD
I
ADD
add
ADD
this
ADD
small
ADD
quantity
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
litre
ADD
of
ADD
water.
ADD
You
ADD
perceive
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
resulting
ADD
mixture
ADD
has
ADD
the
ADD
appearance
ADD
of
ADD
pure
ADD
water.
ADD
The
ADD
proportion
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
cannot
ADD
be
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
one
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
million.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
doubt,
ADD
however,
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
shall
ADD
be
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
obtain
ADD
the
ADD
characteristic
ADD
reaction.”
ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
he
ADD
threw
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
vessel
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
white
ADD
crystals,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
added
ADD
some
ADD
drops
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
transparent
ADD
fluid.
ADD
In
ADD
an
ADD
instant
ADD
the
ADD
contents
ADD
assumed
ADD
a
ADD
dull
ADD
mahogany
ADD
colour,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
brownish
ADD
dust
ADD
was
ADD
precipitated
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
bottom
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
glass
ADD
jar.
ADD

ADD
“Ha!
ADD
ha!”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
clapping
ADD
his
ADD
hands,
ADD
and
ADD
looking
ADD
as
ADD
delighted
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
child
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
new
ADD
toy.
ADD
“What
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
that?”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
seems
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
delicate
ADD
test,”
ADD
I
ADD
remarked.
ADD

ADD
“Beautiful!
ADD
beautiful!
ADD
The
ADD
old
ADD
Guiacum
ADD
test
ADD
was
ADD
very
ADD
clumsy
ADD
and
ADD
uncertain.
ADD
So
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
microscopic
ADD
examination
ADD
for
ADD
blood
ADD
corpuscles.
ADD
The
ADD
latter
ADD
is
ADD
valueless
ADD
if
ADD
the
ADD
stains
ADD
are
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
hours
ADD
old.
ADD
Now,
ADD
this
ADD
appears
ADD
to
ADD
act
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
whether
ADD
the
ADD
blood
ADD
is
ADD
old
ADD
or
ADD
new.
ADD
Had
ADD
this
ADD
test
ADD
been
ADD
invented,
ADD
there
ADD
are
ADD
hundreds
ADD
of
ADD
men
ADD
now
ADD
walking
ADD
the
ADD
earth
ADD
who
ADD
would
ADD
long
ADD
ago
ADD
have
ADD
paid
ADD
the
ADD
penalty
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
crimes.”
ADD

ADD
“Indeed!”
ADD
I
ADD
murmured.
ADD

ADD
“Criminal
ADD
cases
ADD
are
ADD
continually
ADD
hinging
ADD
upon
ADD
that
ADD
one
ADD
point.
ADD
A
ADD
man
ADD
is
ADD
suspected
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
crime
ADD
months
ADD
perhaps
ADD
after
ADD
it
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
committed.
ADD
His
ADD
linen
ADD
or
ADD
clothes
ADD
are
ADD
examined,
ADD
and
ADD
brownish
ADD
stains
ADD
discovered
ADD
upon
ADD
them.
ADD
Are
ADD
they
ADD
blood
ADD
stains,
ADD
or
ADD
mud
ADD
stains,
ADD
or
ADD
rust
ADD
stains,
ADD
or
ADD
fruit
ADD
stains,
ADD
or
ADD
what
ADD
are
ADD
they?
ADD
That
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
question
ADD
which
ADD
has
ADD
puzzled
ADD
many
ADD
an
ADD
expert,
ADD
and
ADD
why?
ADD
Because
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
reliable
ADD
test.
ADD
Now
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes’
ADD
test,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
will
ADD
no
ADD
longer
ADD
be
ADD
any
ADD
difficulty.”
ADD

ADD
His
ADD
eyes
ADD
fairly
ADD
glittered
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
put
ADD
his
ADD
hand
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
heart
ADD
and
ADD
bowed
ADD
as
ADD
if
ADD
to
ADD
some
ADD
applauding
ADD
crowd
ADD
conjured
ADD
up
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
imagination.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
are
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
congratulated,”
ADD
I
ADD
remarked,
ADD
considerably
ADD
surprised
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
enthusiasm.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
of
ADD
Von
ADD
Bischoff
ADD
at
ADD
Frankfort
ADD
last
ADD
year.
ADD
He
ADD
would
ADD
certainly
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
hung
ADD
had
ADD
this
ADD
test
ADD
been
ADD
in
ADD
existence.
ADD
Then
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
Mason
ADD
of
ADD
Bradford,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
notorious
ADD
Muller,
ADD
and
ADD
Lefevre
ADD
of
ADD
Montpellier,
ADD
and
ADD
Samson
ADD
of
ADD
New
ADD
Orleans.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
name
ADD
a
ADD
score
ADD
of
ADD
cases
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
it
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
decisive.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
seem
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
walking
ADD
calendar
ADD
of
ADD
crime,”
ADD
said
ADD
Stamford
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
laugh.
ADD
“You
ADD
might
ADD
start
ADD
a
ADD
paper
ADD
on
ADD
those
ADD
lines.
ADD
Call
ADD
it
ADD
the
ADD
‘Police
ADD
News
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Past.’”
ADD

ADD
“Very
ADD
interesting
ADD
reading
ADD
it
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
made,
ADD
too,”
ADD
remarked
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
sticking
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
piece
ADD
of
ADD
plaster
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
prick
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
finger.
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
careful,”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
turning
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
smile,
ADD
“for
ADD
I
ADD
dabble
ADD
with
ADD
poisons
ADD
a
ADD
good
ADD
deal.”
ADD
He
ADD
held
ADD
out
ADD
his
ADD
hand
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
noticed
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
all
ADD
mottled
ADD
over
ADD
with
ADD
similar
ADD
pieces
ADD
of
ADD
plaster,
ADD
and
ADD
discoloured
ADD
with
ADD
strong
ADD
acids.
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
came
ADD
here
ADD
on
ADD
business,”
ADD
said
ADD
Stamford,
ADD
sitting
ADD
down
ADD
on
ADD
a
ADD
high
ADD
three-legged
ADD
stool,
ADD
and
ADD
pushing
ADD
another
ADD
one
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
direction
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
foot.
ADD
“My
ADD
friend
ADD
here
ADD
wants
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
diggings,
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
were
ADD
complaining
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
could
ADD
get
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
to
ADD
go
ADD
halves
ADD
with
ADD
you,
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
better
ADD
bring
ADD
you
ADD
together.”
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
seemed
ADD
delighted
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
idea
ADD
of
ADD
sharing
ADD
his
ADD
rooms
ADD
with
ADD
me.
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
my
ADD
eye
ADD
on
ADD
a
ADD
suite
ADD
in
ADD
Baker
ADD
Street,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“which
ADD
would
ADD
suit
ADD
us
ADD
down
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
ground.
ADD
You
ADD
don’t
ADD
mind
ADD
the
ADD
smell
ADD
of
ADD
strong
ADD
tobacco,
ADD
I
ADD
hope?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
always
ADD
smoke
ADD
‘ship’s’
ADD
myself,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“That’s
ADD
good
ADD
enough.
ADD
I
ADD
generally
ADD
have
ADD
chemicals
ADD
about,
ADD
and
ADD
occasionally
ADD
do
ADD
experiments.
ADD
Would
ADD
that
ADD
annoy
ADD
you?”
ADD

ADD
“By
ADD
no
ADD
means.”
ADD

ADD
“Let
ADD
me
ADD
see—what
ADD
are
ADD
my
ADD
other
ADD
shortcomings.
ADD
I
ADD
get
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
dumps
ADD
at
ADD
times,
ADD
and
ADD
don’t
ADD
open
ADD
my
ADD
mouth
ADD
for
ADD
days
ADD
on
ADD
end.
ADD
You
ADD
must
ADD
not
ADD
think
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
sulky
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
do
ADD
that.
ADD
Just
ADD
let
ADD
me
ADD
alone,
ADD
and
ADD
I’ll
ADD
soon
ADD
be
ADD
right.
ADD
What
ADD
have
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
confess
ADD
now?
ADD
It’s
ADD
just
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
for
ADD
two
ADD
fellows
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
the
ADD
worst
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
another
ADD
before
ADD
they
ADD
begin
ADD
to
ADD
live
ADD
together.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
laughed
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
cross-examination.
ADD
“I
ADD
keep
ADD
a
ADD
bull
ADD
pup,”
ADD
I
ADD
said,
ADD
“and
ADD
I
ADD
object
ADD
to
ADD
rows
ADD
because
ADD
my
ADD
nerves
ADD
are
ADD
shaken,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
get
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
all
ADD
sorts
ADD
of
ADD
ungodly
ADD
hours,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
extremely
ADD
lazy.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
another
ADD
set
ADD
of
ADD
vices
ADD
when
ADD
I’m
ADD
well,
ADD
but
ADD
those
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
principal
ADD
ones
ADD
at
ADD
present.”
ADD

ADD
“Do
ADD
you
ADD
include
ADD
violin-playing
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
category
ADD
of
ADD
rows?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked,
ADD
anxiously.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
depends
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
player,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD
“A
ADD
well-played
ADD
violin
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
treat
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
gods—a
ADD
badly-played
ADD
one——”
ADD

ADD
“Oh,
ADD
that’s
ADD
all
ADD
right,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
merry
ADD
laugh.
ADD
“I
ADD
think
ADD
we
ADD
may
ADD
consider
ADD
the
ADD
thing
ADD
as
ADD
settled—that
ADD
is,
ADD
if
ADD
the
ADD
rooms
ADD
are
ADD
agreeable
ADD
to
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
“When
ADD
shall
ADD
we
ADD
see
ADD
them?”
ADD

ADD
“Call
ADD
for
ADD
me
ADD
here
ADD
at
ADD
noon
ADD
to-morrow,
ADD
and
ADD
we’ll
ADD
go
ADD
together
ADD
and
ADD
settle
ADD
everything,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“All
ADD
right—noon
ADD
exactly,”
ADD
said
ADD
I,
ADD
shaking
ADD
his
ADD
hand.
ADD

ADD
We
ADD
left
ADD
him
ADD
working
ADD
among
ADD
his
ADD
chemicals,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
walked
ADD
together
ADD
towards
ADD
my
ADD
hotel.
ADD

ADD
“By
ADD
the
ADD
way,”
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
suddenly,
ADD
stopping
ADD
and
ADD
turning
ADD
upon
ADD
Stamford,
ADD
“how
ADD
the
ADD
deuce
ADD
did
ADD
he
ADD
know
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
from
ADD
Afghanistan?”
ADD

ADD
My
ADD
companion
ADD
smiled
ADD
an
ADD
enigmatical
ADD
smile.
ADD
“That’s
ADD
just
ADD
his
ADD
little
ADD
peculiarity,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“A
ADD
good
ADD
many
ADD
people
ADD
have
ADD
wanted
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
how
ADD
he
ADD
finds
ADD
things
ADD
out.”
ADD

ADD
“Oh!
ADD
a
ADD
mystery
ADD
is
ADD
it?”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
rubbing
ADD
my
ADD
hands.
ADD
“This
ADD
is
ADD
very
ADD
piquant.
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
much
ADD
obliged
ADD
to
ADD
you
ADD
for
ADD
bringing
ADD
us
ADD
together.
ADD
‘The
ADD
proper
ADD
study
ADD
of
ADD
mankind
ADD
is
ADD
man,’
ADD
you
ADD
know.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
must
ADD
study
ADD
him,
ADD
then,”
ADD
Stamford
ADD
said,
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
bade
ADD
me
ADD
good-bye.
ADD
“You’ll
ADD
find
ADD
him
ADD
a
ADD
knotty
ADD
problem,
ADD
though.
ADD
I’ll
ADD
wager
ADD
he
ADD
learns
ADD
more
ADD
about
ADD
you
ADD
than
ADD
you
ADD
about
ADD
him.
ADD
Good-bye.”
ADD

ADD
“Good-bye,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered,
ADD
and
ADD
strolled
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
hotel,
ADD
considerably
ADD
interested
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
new
ADD
acquaintance.

ADD

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
II.
ADD
THE
ADD
SCIENCE
ADD
OF
ADD
DEDUCTION.
ADD

ADD
WE
ADD
met
ADD
next
ADD
day
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
arranged,
ADD
and
ADD
inspected
ADD
the
ADD
rooms
ADD
at
ADD
No.
ADD
221B,
ADD
5
ADD
Baker
ADD
Street,
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
spoken
ADD
at
ADD
our
ADD
meeting.
ADD
They
ADD
consisted
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
couple
ADD
of
ADD
comfortable
ADD
bed-rooms
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
single
ADD
large
ADD
airy
ADD
sitting-room,
ADD
cheerfully
ADD
furnished,
ADD
and
ADD
illuminated
ADD
by
ADD
two
ADD
broad
ADD
windows.
ADD
So
ADD
desirable
ADD
in
ADD
every
ADD
way
ADD
were
ADD
the
ADD
apartments,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
moderate
ADD
did
ADD
the
ADD
terms
ADD
seem
ADD
when
ADD
divided
ADD
between
ADD
us,
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
bargain
ADD
was
ADD
concluded
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
spot,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
entered
ADD
into
ADD
possession.
ADD
That
ADD
very
ADD
evening
ADD
I
ADD
moved
ADD
my
ADD
things
ADD
round
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
hotel,
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
following
ADD
morning
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
followed
ADD
me
ADD
with
ADD
several
ADD
boxes
ADD
and
ADD
portmanteaus.
ADD
For
ADD
a
ADD
day
ADD
or
ADD
two
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
busily
ADD
employed
ADD
in
ADD
unpacking
ADD
and
ADD
laying
ADD
out
ADD
our
ADD
property
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
best
ADD
advantage.
ADD
That
ADD
done,
ADD
we
ADD
gradually
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
settle
ADD
down
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
accommodate
ADD
ourselves
ADD
to
ADD
our
ADD
new
ADD
surroundings.
ADD

ADD
Holmes
ADD
was
ADD
certainly
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
difficult
ADD
man
ADD
to
ADD
live
ADD
with.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
quiet
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
ways,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
habits
ADD
were
ADD
regular.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
rare
ADD
for
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
up
ADD
after
ADD
ten
ADD
at
ADD
night,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
invariably
ADD
breakfasted
ADD
and
ADD
gone
ADD
out
ADD
before
ADD
I
ADD
rose
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
morning.
ADD
Sometimes
ADD
he
ADD
spent
ADD
his
ADD
day
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
chemical
ADD
laboratory,
ADD
sometimes
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
dissecting-rooms,
ADD
and
ADD
occasionally
ADD
in
ADD
long
ADD
walks,
ADD
which
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
him
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
lowest
ADD
portions
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
City.
ADD
Nothing
ADD
could
ADD
exceed
ADD
his
ADD
energy
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
working
ADD
fit
ADD
was
ADD
upon
ADD
him;
ADD
but
ADD
now
ADD
and
ADD
again
ADD
a
ADD
reaction
ADD
would
ADD
seize
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
for
ADD
days
ADD
on
ADD
end
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
lie
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
sofa
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
sitting-room,
ADD
hardly
ADD
uttering
ADD
a
ADD
word
ADD
or
ADD
moving
ADD
a
ADD
muscle
ADD
from
ADD
morning
ADD
to
ADD
night.
ADD
On
ADD
these
ADD
occasions
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
noticed
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
dreamy,
ADD
vacant
ADD
expression
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
eyes,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
suspected
ADD
him
ADD
of
ADD
being
ADD
addicted
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
use
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
narcotic,
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
the
ADD
temperance
ADD
and
ADD
cleanliness
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
whole
ADD
life
ADD
forbidden
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
notion.
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
the
ADD
weeks
ADD
went
ADD
by,
ADD
my
ADD
interest
ADD
in
ADD
him
ADD
and
ADD
my
ADD
curiosity
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
aims
ADD
in
ADD
life,
ADD
gradually
ADD
deepened
ADD
and
ADD
increased.
ADD
His
ADD
very
ADD
person
ADD
and
ADD
appearance
ADD
were
ADD
such
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
strike
ADD
the
ADD
attention
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
casual
ADD
observer.
ADD
In
ADD
height
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
rather
ADD
over
ADD
six
ADD
feet,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
excessively
ADD
lean
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
considerably
ADD
taller.
ADD
His
ADD
eyes
ADD
were
ADD
sharp
ADD
and
ADD
piercing,
ADD
save
ADD
during
ADD
those
ADD
intervals
ADD
of
ADD
torpor
ADD
to
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
alluded;
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
thin,
ADD
hawk-like
ADD
nose
ADD
gave
ADD
his
ADD
whole
ADD
expression
ADD
an
ADD
air
ADD
of
ADD
alertness
ADD
and
ADD
decision.
ADD
His
ADD
chin,
ADD
too,
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
prominence
ADD
and
ADD
squareness
ADD
which
ADD
mark
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
of
ADD
determination.
ADD
His
ADD
hands
ADD
were
ADD
invariably
ADD
blotted
ADD
with
ADD
ink
ADD
and
ADD
stained
ADD
with
ADD
chemicals,
ADD
yet
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
possessed
ADD
of
ADD
extraordinary
ADD
delicacy
ADD
of
ADD
touch,
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
frequently
ADD
had
ADD
occasion
ADD
to
ADD
observe
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
watched
ADD
him
ADD
manipulating
ADD
his
ADD
fragile
ADD
philosophical
ADD
instruments.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
reader
ADD
may
ADD
set
ADD
me
ADD
down
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
hopeless
ADD
busybody,
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
confess
ADD
how
ADD
much
ADD
this
ADD
man
ADD
stimulated
ADD
my
ADD
curiosity,
ADD
and
ADD
how
ADD
often
ADD
I
ADD
endeavoured
ADD
to
ADD
break
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
reticence
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
showed
ADD
on
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
concerned
ADD
himself.
ADD
Before
ADD
pronouncing
ADD
judgment,
ADD
however,
ADD
be
ADD
it
ADD
remembered,
ADD
how
ADD
objectless
ADD
was
ADD
my
ADD
life,
ADD
and
ADD
how
ADD
little
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
engage
ADD
my
ADD
attention.
ADD
My
ADD
health
ADD
forbade
ADD
me
ADD
from
ADD
venturing
ADD
out
ADD
unless
ADD
the
ADD
weather
ADD
was
ADD
exceptionally
ADD
genial,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
friends
ADD
who
ADD
would
ADD
call
ADD
upon
ADD
me
ADD
and
ADD
break
ADD
the
ADD
monotony
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
daily
ADD
existence.
ADD
Under
ADD
these
ADD
circumstances,
ADD
I
ADD
eagerly
ADD
hailed
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
mystery
ADD
which
ADD
hung
ADD
around
ADD
my
ADD
companion,
ADD
and
ADD
spent
ADD
much
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
time
ADD
in
ADD
endeavouring
ADD
to
ADD
unravel
ADD
it.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
studying
ADD
medicine.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
himself,
ADD
in
ADD
reply
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
question,
ADD
confirmed
ADD
Stamford’s
ADD
opinion
ADD
upon
ADD
that
ADD
point.
ADD
Neither
ADD
did
ADD
he
ADD
appear
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
pursued
ADD
any
ADD
course
ADD
of
ADD
reading
ADD
which
ADD
might
ADD
fit
ADD
him
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
degree
ADD
in
ADD
science
ADD
or
ADD
any
ADD
other
ADD
recognized
ADD
portal
ADD
which
ADD
would
ADD
give
ADD
him
ADD
an
ADD
entrance
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
learned
ADD
world.
ADD
Yet
ADD
his
ADD
zeal
ADD
for
ADD
certain
ADD
studies
ADD
was
ADD
remarkable,
ADD
and
ADD
within
ADD
eccentric
ADD
limits
ADD
his
ADD
knowledge
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
extraordinarily
ADD
ample
ADD
and
ADD
minute
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
observations
ADD
have
ADD
fairly
ADD
astounded
ADD
me.
ADD
Surely
ADD
no
ADD
man
ADD
would
ADD
work
ADD
so
ADD
hard
ADD
or
ADD
attain
ADD
such
ADD
precise
ADD
information
ADD
unless
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
some
ADD
definite
ADD
end
ADD
in
ADD
view.
ADD
Desultory
ADD
readers
ADD
are
ADD
seldom
ADD
remarkable
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
exactness
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
learning.
ADD
No
ADD
man
ADD
burdens
ADD
his
ADD
mind
ADD
with
ADD
small
ADD
matters
ADD
unless
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
some
ADD
very
ADD
good
ADD
reason
ADD
for
ADD
doing
ADD
so.
ADD

ADD
His
ADD
ignorance
ADD
was
ADD
as
ADD
remarkable
ADD
as
ADD
his
ADD
knowledge.
ADD
Of
ADD
contemporary
ADD
literature,
ADD
philosophy
ADD
and
ADD
politics
ADD
he
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
next
ADD
to
ADD
nothing.
ADD
Upon
ADD
my
ADD
quoting
ADD
Thomas
ADD
Carlyle,
ADD
he
ADD
inquired
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
naivest
ADD
way
ADD
who
ADD
he
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
and
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
done.
ADD
My
ADD
surprise
ADD
reached
ADD
a
ADD
climax,
ADD
however,
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
incidentally
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
ignorant
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Copernican
ADD
Theory
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
composition
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Solar
ADD
System.
ADD
That
ADD
any
ADD
civilized
ADD
human
ADD
being
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
nineteenth
ADD
century
ADD
should
ADD
not
ADD
be
ADD
aware
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
earth
ADD
travelled
ADD
round
ADD
the
ADD
sun
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
such
ADD
an
ADD
extraordinary
ADD
fact
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
hardly
ADD
realize
ADD
it.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
appear
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
astonished,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
smiling
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
expression
ADD
of
ADD
surprise.
ADD
“Now
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
do
ADD
know
ADD
it
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
do
ADD
my
ADD
best
ADD
to
ADD
forget
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“To
ADD
forget
ADD
it!”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
see,”
ADD
he
ADD
explained,
ADD
“I
ADD
consider
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
man’s
ADD
brain
ADD
originally
ADD
is
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
empty
ADD
attic,
ADD
and
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
to
ADD
stock
ADD
it
ADD
with
ADD
such
ADD
furniture
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
choose.
ADD
A
ADD
fool
ADD
takes
ADD
in
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
lumber
ADD
of
ADD
every
ADD
sort
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
comes
ADD
across,
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
knowledge
ADD
which
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
useful
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
gets
ADD
crowded
ADD
out,
ADD
or
ADD
at
ADD
best
ADD
is
ADD
jumbled
ADD
up
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
lot
ADD
of
ADD
other
ADD
things
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
a
ADD
difficulty
ADD
in
ADD
laying
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
upon
ADD
it.
ADD
Now
ADD
the
ADD
skilful
ADD
workman
ADD
is
ADD
very
ADD
careful
ADD
indeed
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
takes
ADD
into
ADD
his
ADD
brain-attic.
ADD
He
ADD
will
ADD
have
ADD
nothing
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
tools
ADD
which
ADD
may
ADD
help
ADD
him
ADD
in
ADD
doing
ADD
his
ADD
work,
ADD
but
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
assortment,
ADD
and
ADD
all
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
perfect
ADD
order.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
mistake
ADD
to
ADD
think
ADD
that
ADD
that
ADD
little
ADD
room
ADD
has
ADD
elastic
ADD
walls
ADD
and
ADD
can
ADD
distend
ADD
to
ADD
any
ADD
extent.
ADD
Depend
ADD
upon
ADD
it
ADD
there
ADD
comes
ADD
a
ADD
time
ADD
when
ADD
for
ADD
every
ADD
addition
ADD
of
ADD
knowledge
ADD
you
ADD
forget
ADD
something
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
knew
ADD
before.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
highest
ADD
importance,
ADD
therefore,
ADD
not
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
useless
ADD
facts
ADD
elbowing
ADD
out
ADD
the
ADD
useful
ADD
ones.”
ADD

ADD
“But
ADD
the
ADD
Solar
ADD
System!”
ADD
I
ADD
protested.
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
the
ADD
deuce
ADD
is
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
me?”
ADD
he
ADD
interrupted
ADD
impatiently;
ADD
“you
ADD
say
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
go
ADD
round
ADD
the
ADD
sun.
ADD
If
ADD
we
ADD
went
ADD
round
ADD
the
ADD
moon
ADD
it
ADD
would
ADD
not
ADD
make
ADD
a
ADD
pennyworth
ADD
of
ADD
difference
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
or
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
work.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
point
ADD
of
ADD
asking
ADD
him
ADD
what
ADD
that
ADD
work
ADD
might
ADD
be,
ADD
but
ADD
something
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
manner
ADD
showed
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
question
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
an
ADD
unwelcome
ADD
one.
ADD
I
ADD
pondered
ADD
over
ADD
our
ADD
short
ADD
conversation,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
endeavoured
ADD
to
ADD
draw
ADD
my
ADD
deductions
ADD
from
ADD
it.
ADD
He
ADD
said
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
acquire
ADD
no
ADD
knowledge
ADD
which
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
bear
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
object.
ADD
Therefore
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
knowledge
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
possessed
ADD
was
ADD
such
ADD
as
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
useful
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
I
ADD
enumerated
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
mind
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
various
ADD
points
ADD
upon
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
shown
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
exceptionally
ADD
well-informed.
ADD
I
ADD
even
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
pencil
ADD
and
ADD
jotted
ADD
them
ADD
down.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
help
ADD
smiling
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
document
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
completed
ADD
it.
ADD

way—

ADD

ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
got
ADD
so
ADD
far
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
list
ADD
I
ADD
threw
ADD
it
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
fire
ADD
in
ADD
despair.
ADD
“If
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
only
ADD
find
ADD
what
ADD
the
ADD
fellow
ADD
is
ADD
driving
ADD
at
ADD
by
ADD
reconciling
ADD
all
ADD
these
ADD
accomplishments,
ADD
and
ADD
discovering
ADD
a
ADD
calling
ADD
which
ADD
needs
ADD
them
ADD
all,”
ADD
I
ADD
said
ADD
to
ADD
myself,
ADD
“I
ADD
may
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
give
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
attempt
ADD
at
ADD
once.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
see
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
alluded
ADD
above
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
powers
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
violin.
ADD
These
ADD
were
ADD
very
ADD
remarkable,
ADD
but
ADD
as
ADD
eccentric
ADD
as
ADD
all
ADD
his
ADD
other
ADD
accomplishments.
ADD
That
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
play
ADD
pieces,
ADD
and
ADD
difficult
ADD
pieces,
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
well,
ADD
because
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
request
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
played
ADD
me
ADD
some
ADD
of
ADD
Mendelssohn’s
ADD
Lieder,
ADD
and
ADD
other
ADD
favourites.
ADD
When
ADD
left
ADD
to
ADD
himself,
ADD
however,
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
seldom
ADD
produce
ADD
any
ADD
music
ADD
or
ADD
attempt
ADD
any
ADD
recognized
ADD
air.
ADD
Leaning
ADD
back
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
arm-chair
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
evening,
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
close
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
and
ADD
scrape
ADD
carelessly
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
fiddle
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
thrown
ADD
across
ADD
his
ADD
knee.
ADD
Sometimes
ADD
the
ADD
chords
ADD
were
ADD
sonorous
ADD
and
ADD
melancholy.
ADD
Occasionally
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
fantastic
ADD
and
ADD
cheerful.
ADD
Clearly
ADD
they
ADD
reflected
ADD
the
ADD
thoughts
ADD
which
ADD
possessed
ADD
him,
ADD
but
ADD
whether
ADD
the
ADD
music
ADD
aided
ADD
those
ADD
thoughts,
ADD
or
ADD
whether
ADD
the
ADD
playing
ADD
was
ADD
simply
ADD
the
ADD
result
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
whim
ADD
or
ADD
fancy
ADD
was
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
determine.
ADD
I
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
rebelled
ADD
against
ADD
these
ADD
exasperating
ADD
solos
ADD
had
ADD
it
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
usually
ADD
terminated
ADD
them
ADD
by
ADD
playing
ADD
in
ADD
quick
ADD
succession
ADD
a
ADD
whole
ADD
series
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
favourite
ADD
airs
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
slight
ADD
compensation
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
trial
ADD
upon
ADD
my
ADD
patience.
ADD

ADD
During
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
week
ADD
or
ADD
so
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
callers,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
begun
ADD
to
ADD
think
ADD
that
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
was
ADD
as
ADD
friendless
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
myself.
ADD
Presently,
ADD
however,
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
many
ADD
acquaintances,
ADD
and
ADD
those
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
different
ADD
classes
ADD
of
ADD
society.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
one
ADD
little
ADD
sallow
ADD
rat-faced,
ADD
dark-eyed
ADD
fellow
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
introduced
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
as
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
and
ADD
who
ADD
came
ADD
three
ADD
or
ADD
four
ADD
times
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
single
ADD
week.
ADD
One
ADD
morning
ADD
a
ADD
young
ADD
girl
ADD
called,
ADD
fashionably
ADD
dressed,
ADD
and
ADD
stayed
ADD
for
ADD
half
ADD
an
ADD
hour
ADD
or
ADD
more.
ADD
The
ADD
same
ADD
afternoon
ADD
brought
ADD
a
ADD
grey-headed,
ADD
seedy
ADD
visitor,
ADD
looking
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
Jew
ADD
pedlar,
ADD
who
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
much
ADD
excited,
ADD
and
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
closely
ADD
followed
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
slip-shod
ADD
elderly
ADD
woman.
ADD
On
ADD
another
ADD
occasion
ADD
an
ADD
old
ADD
white-haired
ADD
gentleman
ADD
had
ADD
an
ADD
interview
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
companion;
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
another
ADD
a
ADD
railway
ADD
porter
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
velveteen
ADD
uniform.
ADD
When
ADD
any
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
nondescript
ADD
individuals
ADD
put
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
appearance,
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
used
ADD
to
ADD
beg
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
use
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
sitting-room,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
would
ADD
retire
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
bed-room.
ADD
He
ADD
always
ADD
apologized
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
for
ADD
putting
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
inconvenience.
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
to
ADD
use
ADD
this
ADD
room
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
place
ADD
of
ADD
business,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“and
ADD
these
ADD
people
ADD
are
ADD
my
ADD
clients.”
ADD
Again
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
an
ADD
opportunity
ADD
of
ADD
asking
ADD
him
ADD
a
ADD
point
ADD
blank
ADD
question,
ADD
and
ADD
again
ADD
my
ADD
delicacy
ADD
prevented
ADD
me
ADD
from
ADD
forcing
ADD
another
ADD
man
ADD
to
ADD
confide
ADD
in
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
imagined
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
some
ADD
strong
ADD
reason
ADD
for
ADD
not
ADD
alluding
ADD
to
ADD
it,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
soon
ADD
dispelled
ADD
the
ADD
idea
ADD
by
ADD
coming
ADD
round
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
subject
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
accord.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
4th
ADD
of
ADD
March,
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
good
ADD
reason
ADD
to
ADD
remember,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
rose
ADD
somewhat
ADD
earlier
ADD
than
ADD
usual,
ADD
and
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
yet
ADD
finished
ADD
his
ADD
breakfast.
ADD
The
ADD
landlady
ADD
had
ADD
become
ADD
so
ADD
accustomed
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
late
ADD
habits
ADD
that
ADD
my
ADD
place
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
laid
ADD
nor
ADD
my
ADD
coffee
ADD
prepared.
ADD
With
ADD
the
ADD
unreasonable
ADD
petulance
ADD
of
ADD
mankind
ADD
I
ADD
rang
ADD
the
ADD
bell
ADD
and
ADD
gave
ADD
a
ADD
curt
ADD
intimation
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
ready.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
picked
ADD
up
ADD
a
ADD
magazine
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
table
ADD
and
ADD
attempted
ADD
to
ADD
while
ADD
away
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
with
ADD
it,
ADD
while
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
munched
ADD
silently
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
toast.
ADD
One
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
articles
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
pencil
ADD
mark
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
heading,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
naturally
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
run
ADD
my
ADD
eye
ADD
through
ADD
it.
ADD

ADD
Its
ADD
somewhat
ADD
ambitious
ADD
title
ADD
was
ADD
“The
ADD
Book
ADD
of
ADD
Life,”
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
attempted
ADD
to
ADD
show
ADD
how
ADD
much
ADD
an
ADD
observant
ADD
man
ADD
might
ADD
learn
ADD
by
ADD
an
ADD
accurate
ADD
and
ADD
systematic
ADD
examination
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
came
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
way.
ADD
It
ADD
struck
ADD
me
ADD
as
ADD
being
ADD
a
ADD
remarkable
ADD
mixture
ADD
of
ADD
shrewdness
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
absurdity.
ADD
The
ADD
reasoning
ADD
was
ADD
close
ADD
and
ADD
intense,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
deductions
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
far-fetched
ADD
and
ADD
exaggerated.
ADD
The
ADD
writer
ADD
claimed
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
momentary
ADD
expression,
ADD
a
ADD
twitch
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
muscle
ADD
or
ADD
a
ADD
glance
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
eye,
ADD
to
ADD
fathom
ADD
a
ADD
man’s
ADD
inmost
ADD
thoughts.
ADD
Deceit,
ADD
according
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
was
ADD
an
ADD
impossibility
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
trained
ADD
to
ADD
observation
ADD
and
ADD
analysis.
ADD
His
ADD
conclusions
ADD
were
ADD
as
ADD
infallible
ADD
as
ADD
so
ADD
many
ADD
propositions
ADD
of
ADD
Euclid.
ADD
So
ADD
startling
ADD
would
ADD
his
ADD
results
ADD
appear
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
uninitiated
ADD
that
ADD
until
ADD
they
ADD
learned
ADD
the
ADD
processes
ADD
by
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
arrived
ADD
at
ADD
them
ADD
they
ADD
might
ADD
well
ADD
consider
ADD
him
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
necromancer.
ADD

ADD
“From
ADD
a
ADD
drop
ADD
of
ADD
water,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
writer,
ADD
“a
ADD
logician
ADD
could
ADD
infer
ADD
the
ADD
possibility
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
Atlantic
ADD
or
ADD
a
ADD
Niagara
ADD
without
ADD
having
ADD
seen
ADD
or
ADD
heard
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
or
ADD
the
ADD
other.
ADD
So
ADD
all
ADD
life
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
chain,
ADD
the
ADD
nature
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
known
ADD
whenever
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
shown
ADD
a
ADD
single
ADD
link
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
Like
ADD
all
ADD
other
ADD
arts,
ADD
the
ADD
Science
ADD
of
ADD
Deduction
ADD
and
ADD
Analysis
ADD
is
ADD
one
ADD
which
ADD
can
ADD
only
ADD
be
ADD
acquired
ADD
by
ADD
long
ADD
and
ADD
patient
ADD
study
ADD
nor
ADD
is
ADD
life
ADD
long
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
allow
ADD
any
ADD
mortal
ADD
to
ADD
attain
ADD
the
ADD
highest
ADD
possible
ADD
perfection
ADD
in
ADD
it.
ADD
Before
ADD
turning
ADD
to
ADD
those
ADD
moral
ADD
and
ADD
mental
ADD
aspects
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
matter
ADD
which
ADD
present
ADD
the
ADD
greatest
ADD
difficulties,
ADD
let
ADD
the
ADD
enquirer
ADD
begin
ADD
by
ADD
mastering
ADD
more
ADD
elementary
ADD
problems.
ADD
Let
ADD
him,
ADD
on
ADD
meeting
ADD
a
ADD
fellow-mortal,
ADD
learn
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
glance
ADD
to
ADD
distinguish
ADD
the
ADD
history
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
man,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
trade
ADD
or
ADD
profession
ADD
to
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
belongs.
ADD
Puerile
ADD
as
ADD
such
ADD
an
ADD
exercise
ADD
may
ADD
seem,
ADD
it
ADD
sharpens
ADD
the
ADD
faculties
ADD
of
ADD
observation,
ADD
and
ADD
teaches
ADD
one
ADD
where
ADD
to
ADD
look
ADD
and
ADD
what
ADD
to
ADD
look
ADD
for.
ADD
By
ADD
a
ADD
man’s
ADD
finger
ADD
nails,
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
coat-sleeve,
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
boot,
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
trouser
ADD
knees,
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
callosities
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
forefinger
ADD
and
ADD
thumb,
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
expression,
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
shirt
ADD
cuffs—by
ADD
each
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
things
ADD
a
ADD
man’s
ADD
calling
ADD
is
ADD
plainly
ADD
revealed.
ADD
That
ADD
all
ADD
united
ADD
should
ADD
fail
ADD
to
ADD
enlighten
ADD
the
ADD
competent
ADD
enquirer
ADD
in
ADD
any
ADD
case
ADD
is
ADD
almost
ADD
inconceivable.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
ineffable
ADD
twaddle!”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
slapping
ADD
the
ADD
magazine
ADD
down
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
table,
ADD
“I
ADD
never
ADD
read
ADD
such
ADD
rubbish
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
life.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
is
ADD
it?”
ADD
asked
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
this
ADD
article,”
ADD
I
ADD
said,
ADD
pointing
ADD
at
ADD
it
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
egg
ADD
spoon
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
sat
ADD
down
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
breakfast.
ADD
“I
ADD
see
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
read
ADD
it
ADD
since
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
marked
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
deny
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
smartly
ADD
written.
ADD
It
ADD
irritates
ADD
me
ADD
though.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
evidently
ADD
the
ADD
theory
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
arm-chair
ADD
lounger
ADD
who
ADD
evolves
ADD
all
ADD
these
ADD
neat
ADD
little
ADD
paradoxes
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
seclusion
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
study.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
practical.
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
like
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
him
ADD
clapped
ADD
down
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
third
ADD
class
ADD
carriage
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
Underground,
ADD
and
ADD
asked
ADD
to
ADD
give
ADD
the
ADD
trades
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
his
ADD
fellow-travellers.
ADD
I
ADD
would
ADD
lay
ADD
a
ADD
thousand
ADD
to
ADD
one
ADD
against
ADD
him.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
would
ADD
lose
ADD
your
ADD
money,”
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
remarked
ADD
calmly.
ADD
“As
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
article
ADD
I
ADD
wrote
ADD
it
ADD
myself.”
ADD

ADD
“You!”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
turn
ADD
both
ADD
for
ADD
observation
ADD
and
ADD
for
ADD
deduction.
ADD
The
ADD
theories
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
expressed
ADD
there,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
appear
ADD
to
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
so
ADD
chimerical
ADD
are
ADD
really
ADD
extremely
ADD
practical—so
ADD
practical
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
depend
ADD
upon
ADD
them
ADD
for
ADD
my
ADD
bread
ADD
and
ADD
cheese.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
how?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
involuntarily.
ADD

ADD
“Well,
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
trade
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
own.
ADD
I
ADD
suppose
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
the
ADD
only
ADD
one
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
world.
ADD
I’m
ADD
a
ADD
consulting
ADD
detective,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
can
ADD
understand
ADD
what
ADD
that
ADD
is.
ADD
Here
ADD
in
ADD
London
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
lots
ADD
of
ADD
Government
ADD
detectives
ADD
and
ADD
lots
ADD
of
ADD
private
ADD
ones.
ADD
When
ADD
these
ADD
fellows
ADD
are
ADD
at
ADD
fault
ADD
they
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
manage
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
them
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
right
ADD
scent.
ADD
They
ADD
lay
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
evidence
ADD
before
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
generally
ADD
able,
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
help
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
knowledge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
history
ADD
of
ADD
crime,
ADD
to
ADD
set
ADD
them
ADD
straight.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
strong
ADD
family
ADD
resemblance
ADD
about
ADD
misdeeds,
ADD
and
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
details
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
thousand
ADD
at
ADD
your
ADD
finger
ADD
ends,
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
odd
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
can’t
ADD
unravel
ADD
the
ADD
thousand
ADD
and
ADD
first.
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
well-known
ADD
detective.
ADD
He
ADD
got
ADD
himself
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
fog
ADD
recently
ADD
over
ADD
a
ADD
forgery
ADD
case,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
what
ADD
brought
ADD
him
ADD
here.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
these
ADD
other
ADD
people?”
ADD

ADD
“They
ADD
are
ADD
mostly
ADD
sent
ADD
on
ADD
by
ADD
private
ADD
inquiry
ADD
agencies.
ADD
They
ADD
are
ADD
all
ADD
people
ADD
who
ADD
are
ADD
in
ADD
trouble
ADD
about
ADD
something,
ADD
and
ADD
want
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
enlightening.
ADD
I
ADD
listen
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
story,
ADD
they
ADD
listen
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
comments,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
I
ADD
pocket
ADD
my
ADD
fee.”
ADD

ADD
“But
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
mean
ADD
to
ADD
say,”
ADD
I
ADD
said,
ADD
“that
ADD
without
ADD
leaving
ADD
your
ADD
room
ADD
you
ADD
can
ADD
unravel
ADD
some
ADD
knot
ADD
which
ADD
other
ADD
men
ADD
can
ADD
make
ADD
nothing
ADD
of,
ADD
although
ADD
they
ADD
have
ADD
seen
ADD
every
ADD
detail
ADD
for
ADD
themselves?”
ADD

ADD
“Quite
ADD
so.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
kind
ADD
of
ADD
intuition
ADD
that
ADD
way.
ADD
Now
ADD
and
ADD
again
ADD
a
ADD
case
ADD
turns
ADD
up
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
more
ADD
complex.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
to
ADD
bustle
ADD
about
ADD
and
ADD
see
ADD
things
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
eyes.
ADD
You
ADD
see
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
lot
ADD
of
ADD
special
ADD
knowledge
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
apply
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
problem,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
facilitates
ADD
matters
ADD
wonderfully.
ADD
Those
ADD
rules
ADD
of
ADD
deduction
ADD
laid
ADD
down
ADD
in
ADD
that
ADD
article
ADD
which
ADD
aroused
ADD
your
ADD
scorn,
ADD
are
ADD
invaluable
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
in
ADD
practical
ADD
work.
ADD
Observation
ADD
with
ADD
me
ADD
is
ADD
second
ADD
nature.
ADD
You
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
surprised
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
told
ADD
you,
ADD
on
ADD
our
ADD
first
ADD
meeting,
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
from
ADD
Afghanistan.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
were
ADD
told,
ADD
no
ADD
doubt.”
ADD

ADD
“Nothing
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
sort.
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
you
ADD
came
ADD
from
ADD
Afghanistan.
ADD
From
ADD
long
ADD
habit
ADD
the
ADD
train
ADD
of
ADD
thoughts
ADD
ran
ADD
so
ADD
swiftly
ADD
through
ADD
my
ADD
mind,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
arrived
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
conclusion
ADD
without
ADD
being
ADD
conscious
ADD
of
ADD
intermediate
ADD
steps.
ADD
There
ADD
were
ADD
such
ADD
steps,
ADD
however.
ADD
The
ADD
train
ADD
of
ADD
reasoning
ADD
ran,
ADD
‘Here
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
gentleman
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
medical
ADD
type,
ADD
but
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
air
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
military
ADD
man.
ADD
Clearly
ADD
an
ADD
army
ADD
doctor,
ADD
then.
ADD
He
ADD
has
ADD
just
ADD
come
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
tropics,
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
is
ADD
dark,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
the
ADD
natural
ADD
tint
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
skin,
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
wrists
ADD
are
ADD
fair.
ADD
He
ADD
has
ADD
undergone
ADD
hardship
ADD
and
ADD
sickness,
ADD
as
ADD
his
ADD
haggard
ADD
face
ADD
says
ADD
clearly.
ADD
His
ADD
left
ADD
arm
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
injured.
ADD
He
ADD
holds
ADD
it
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
stiff
ADD
and
ADD
unnatural
ADD
manner.
ADD
Where
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
tropics
ADD
could
ADD
an
ADD
English
ADD
army
ADD
doctor
ADD
have
ADD
seen
ADD
much
ADD
hardship
ADD
and
ADD
got
ADD
his
ADD
arm
ADD
wounded?
ADD
Clearly
ADD
in
ADD
Afghanistan.’
ADD
The
ADD
whole
ADD
train
ADD
of
ADD
thought
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
occupy
ADD
a
ADD
second.
ADD
I
ADD
then
ADD
remarked
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
came
ADD
from
ADD
Afghanistan,
ADD
and
ADD
you
ADD
were
ADD
astonished.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
simple
ADD
enough
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
explain
ADD
it,”
ADD
I
ADD
said,
ADD
smiling.
ADD
“You
ADD
remind
ADD
me
ADD
of
ADD
Edgar
ADD
Allen
ADD
Poe’s
ADD
Dupin.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
idea
ADD
that
ADD
such
ADD
individuals
ADD
did
ADD
exist
ADD
outside
ADD
of
ADD
stories.”
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
rose
ADD
and
ADD
lit
ADD
his
ADD
pipe.
ADD
“No
ADD
doubt
ADD
you
ADD
think
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
complimenting
ADD
me
ADD
in
ADD
comparing
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
Dupin,”
ADD
he
ADD
observed.
ADD
“Now,
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
opinion,
ADD
Dupin
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
inferior
ADD
fellow.
ADD
That
ADD
trick
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
of
ADD
breaking
ADD
in
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
friends’
ADD
thoughts
ADD
with
ADD
an
ADD
apropos
ADD
remark
ADD
after
ADD
a
ADD
quarter
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
hour’s
ADD
silence
ADD
is
ADD
really
ADD
very
ADD
showy
ADD
and
ADD
superficial.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
some
ADD
analytical
ADD
genius,
ADD
no
ADD
doubt;
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
by
ADD
no
ADD
means
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
phenomenon
ADD
as
ADD
Poe
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
imagine.”
ADD

ADD
“Have
ADD
you
ADD
read
ADD
Gaboriau’s
ADD
works?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD
“Does
ADD
Lecoq
ADD
come
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
your
ADD
idea
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
detective?”
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
sniffed
ADD
sardonically.
ADD
“Lecoq
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
miserable
ADD
bungler,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
angry
ADD
voice;
ADD
“he
ADD
had
ADD
only
ADD
one
ADD
thing
ADD
to
ADD
recommend
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
his
ADD
energy.
ADD
That
ADD
book
ADD
made
ADD
me
ADD
positively
ADD
ill.
ADD
The
ADD
question
ADD
was
ADD
how
ADD
to
ADD
identify
ADD
an
ADD
unknown
ADD
prisoner.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
have
ADD
done
ADD
it
ADD
in
ADD
twenty-four
ADD
hours.
ADD
Lecoq
ADD
took
ADD
six
ADD
months
ADD
or
ADD
so.
ADD
It
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
made
ADD
a
ADD
text-book
ADD
for
ADD
detectives
ADD
to
ADD
teach
ADD
them
ADD
what
ADD
to
ADD
avoid.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
felt
ADD
rather
ADD
indignant
ADD
at
ADD
having
ADD
two
ADD
characters
ADD
whom
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
admired
ADD
treated
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
cavalier
ADD
style.
ADD
I
ADD
walked
ADD
over
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
window,
ADD
and
ADD
stood
ADD
looking
ADD
out
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
busy
ADD
street.
ADD
“This
ADD
fellow
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
very
ADD
clever,”
ADD
I
ADD
said
ADD
to
ADD
myself,
ADD
“but
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
certainly
ADD
very
ADD
conceited.”
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
are
ADD
no
ADD
crimes
ADD
and
ADD
no
ADD
criminals
ADD
in
ADD
these
ADD
days,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
querulously.
ADD
“What
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
use
ADD
of
ADD
having
ADD
brains
ADD
in
ADD
our
ADD
profession.
ADD
I
ADD
know
ADD
well
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
it
ADD
in
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
make
ADD
my
ADD
name
ADD
famous.
ADD
No
ADD
man
ADD
lives
ADD
or
ADD
has
ADD
ever
ADD
lived
ADD
who
ADD
has
ADD
brought
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
amount
ADD
of
ADD
study
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
natural
ADD
talent
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
detection
ADD
of
ADD
crime
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
done.
ADD
And
ADD
what
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
result?
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
crime
ADD
to
ADD
detect,
ADD
or,
ADD
at
ADD
most,
ADD
some
ADD
bungling
ADD
villainy
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
motive
ADD
so
ADD
transparent
ADD
that
ADD
even
ADD
a
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yard
ADD
official
ADD
can
ADD
see
ADD
through
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
annoyed
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
bumptious
ADD
style
ADD
of
ADD
conversation.
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
it
ADD
best
ADD
to
ADD
change
ADD
the
ADD
topic.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
wonder
ADD
what
ADD
that
ADD
fellow
ADD
is
ADD
looking
ADD
for?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked,
ADD
pointing
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
stalwart,
ADD
plainly-dressed
ADD
individual
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
walking
ADD
slowly
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
side
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
street,
ADD
looking
ADD
anxiously
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
numbers.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
blue
ADD
envelope
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
hand,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
evidently
ADD
the
ADD
bearer
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
message.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
mean
ADD
the
ADD
retired
ADD
sergeant
ADD
of
ADD
Marines,”
ADD
said
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD

ADD
“Brag
ADD
and
ADD
bounce!”
ADD
thought
ADD
I
ADD
to
ADD
myself.
ADD
“He
ADD
knows
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
cannot
ADD
verify
ADD
his
ADD
guess.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
thought
ADD
had
ADD
hardly
ADD
passed
ADD
through
ADD
my
ADD
mind
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
whom
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
watching
ADD
caught
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
number
ADD
on
ADD
our
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
ran
ADD
rapidly
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
roadway.
ADD
We
ADD
heard
ADD
a
ADD
loud
ADD
knock,
ADD
a
ADD
deep
ADD
voice
ADD
below,
ADD
and
ADD
heavy
ADD
steps
ADD
ascending
ADD
the
ADD
stair.
ADD

ADD
“For
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
stepping
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
and
ADD
handing
ADD
my
ADD
friend
ADD
the
ADD
letter.
ADD

ADD
Here
ADD
was
ADD
an
ADD
opportunity
ADD
of
ADD
taking
ADD
the
ADD
conceit
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
him.
ADD
He
ADD
little
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
made
ADD
that
ADD
random
ADD
shot.
ADD
“May
ADD
I
ADD
ask,
ADD
my
ADD
lad,”
ADD
I
ADD
said,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
blandest
ADD
voice,
ADD
“what
ADD
your
ADD
trade
ADD
may
ADD
be?”
ADD

ADD
“Commissionaire,
ADD
sir,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
gruffly.
ADD
“Uniform
ADD
away
ADD
for
ADD
repairs.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
you
ADD
were?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
slightly
ADD
malicious
ADD
glance
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
companion.
ADD

ADD
“A
ADD
sergeant,
ADD
sir,
ADD
Royal
ADD
Marine
ADD
Light
ADD
Infantry,
ADD
sir.
ADD
No
ADD
answer?
ADD
Right,
ADD
sir.”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
clicked
ADD
his
ADD
heels
ADD
together,
ADD
raised
ADD
his
ADD
hand
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
salute,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
gone.

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
III.
ADD
THE
ADD
LAURISTON
ADD
GARDEN
ADD
MYSTERY
ADD
6
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
CONFESS
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
considerably
ADD
startled
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
fresh
ADD
proof
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
practical
ADD
nature
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
companion’s
ADD
theories.
ADD
My
ADD
respect
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
powers
ADD
of
ADD
analysis
ADD
increased
ADD
wondrously.
ADD
There
ADD
still
ADD
remained
ADD
some
ADD
lurking
ADD
suspicion
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
mind,
ADD
however,
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
thing
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
pre-arranged
ADD
episode,
ADD
intended
ADD
to
ADD
dazzle
ADD
me,
ADD
though
ADD
what
ADD
earthly
ADD
object
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
have
ADD
in
ADD
taking
ADD
me
ADD
in
ADD
was
ADD
past
ADD
my
ADD
comprehension.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
looked
ADD
at
ADD
him
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
finished
ADD
reading
ADD
the
ADD
note,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
had
ADD
assumed
ADD
the
ADD
vacant,
ADD
lack-lustre
ADD
expression
ADD
which
ADD
showed
ADD
mental
ADD
abstraction.
ADD

ADD
“How
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
world
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
deduce
ADD
that?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Deduce
ADD
what?”
ADD
said
ADD
he,
ADD
petulantly.
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
retired
ADD
sergeant
ADD
of
ADD
Marines.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
time
ADD
for
ADD
trifles,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered,
ADD
brusquely;
ADD
then
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
smile,
ADD
“Excuse
ADD
my
ADD
rudeness.
ADD
You
ADD
broke
ADD
the
ADD
thread
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
thoughts;
ADD
but
ADD
perhaps
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
as
ADD
well.
ADD
So
ADD
you
ADD
actually
ADD
were
ADD
not
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
that
ADD
that
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
sergeant
ADD
of
ADD
Marines?”
ADD

ADD
“No,
ADD
indeed.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
was
ADD
easier
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
it
ADD
than
ADD
to
ADD
explain
ADD
why
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
it.
ADD
If
ADD
you
ADD
were
ADD
asked
ADD
to
ADD
prove
ADD
that
ADD
two
ADD
and
ADD
two
ADD
made
ADD
four,
ADD
you
ADD
might
ADD
find
ADD
some
ADD
difficulty,
ADD
and
ADD
yet
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
quite
ADD
sure
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
fact.
ADD
Even
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
street
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
blue
ADD
anchor
ADD
tattooed
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
back
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
fellow’s
ADD
hand.
ADD
That
ADD
smacked
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
sea.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
military
ADD
carriage,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
regulation
ADD
side
ADD
whiskers.
ADD
There
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
marine.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
with
ADD
some
ADD
amount
ADD
of
ADD
self-importance
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
certain
ADD
air
ADD
of
ADD
command.
ADD
You
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
observed
ADD
the
ADD
way
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
held
ADD
his
ADD
head
ADD
and
ADD
swung
ADD
his
ADD
cane.
ADD
A
ADD
steady,
ADD
respectable,
ADD
middle-aged
ADD
man,
ADD
too,
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
face
ADD
of
ADD
him—all
ADD
facts
ADD
which
ADD
led
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
believe
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
sergeant.”
ADD

ADD
“Wonderful!”
ADD
I
ADD
ejaculated.
ADD

ADD
“Commonplace,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
though
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
expression
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
pleased
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
evident
ADD
surprise
ADD
and
ADD
admiration.
ADD
“I
ADD
said
ADD
just
ADD
now
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
no
ADD
criminals.
ADD
It
ADD
appears
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
wrong—look
ADD
at
ADD
this!”
ADD
He
ADD
threw
ADD
me
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
note
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
commissionaire
ADD
had
ADD
brought.
ADD
7
ADD

ADD
“Why,”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
cast
ADD
my
ADD
eye
ADD
over
ADD
it,
ADD
“this
ADD
is
ADD
terrible!”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
does
ADD
seem
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
common,”
ADD
he
ADD
remarked,
ADD
calmly.
ADD
“Would
ADD
you
ADD
mind
ADD
reading
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
aloud?”
ADD

ADD
This
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
letter
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
read
ADD
to
ADD
him——
ADD

ADD
“MY
ADD
DEAR
ADD
MR.
ADD
SHERLOCK
ADD
HOLMES,—
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
bad
ADD
business
ADD
during
ADD
the
ADD
night
ADD
at
ADD
3,
ADD
Lauriston
ADD
Gardens,
ADD
off
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road.
ADD
Our
ADD
man
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
beat
ADD
saw
ADD
a
ADD
light
ADD
there
ADD
about
ADD
two
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
morning,
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
was
ADD
an
ADD
empty
ADD
one,
ADD
suspected
ADD
that
ADD
something
ADD
was
ADD
amiss.
ADD
He
ADD
found
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
open,
ADD
and
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
front
ADD
room,
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
bare
ADD
of
ADD
furniture,
ADD
discovered
ADD
the
ADD
body
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
gentleman,
ADD
well
ADD
dressed,
ADD
and
ADD
having
ADD
cards
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
pocket
ADD
bearing
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
‘Enoch
ADD
J.
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
Cleveland,
ADD
Ohio,
ADD
U.S.A.’
ADD
There
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
no
ADD
robbery,
ADD
nor
ADD
is
ADD
there
ADD
any
ADD
evidence
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
how
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
met
ADD
his
ADD
death.
ADD
There
ADD
are
ADD
marks
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
but
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
wound
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
person.
ADD
We
ADD
are
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
loss
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
how
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
empty
ADD
house;
ADD
indeed,
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
affair
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
puzzler.
ADD
If
ADD
you
ADD
can
ADD
come
ADD
round
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
any
ADD
time
ADD
before
ADD
twelve,
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
find
ADD
me
ADD
there.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
left
ADD
everything
ADD
in
ADD
statu
ADD
quo
ADD
until
ADD
I
ADD
hear
ADD
from
ADD
you.
ADD
If
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
unable
ADD
to
ADD
come
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
give
ADD
you
ADD
fuller
ADD
details,
ADD
and
ADD
would
ADD
esteem
ADD
it
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
kindness
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
would
ADD
favour
ADD
me
ADD
with
ADD
your
ADD
opinion.
ADD
Yours
ADD
faithfully,
ADD

ADD
“TOBIAS
ADD
GREGSON.”
ADD

ADD
“Gregson
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
smartest
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yarders,”
ADD
my
ADD
friend
ADD
remarked;
ADD
“he
ADD
and
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
pick
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
bad
ADD
lot.
ADD
They
ADD
are
ADD
both
ADD
quick
ADD
and
ADD
energetic,
ADD
but
ADD
conventional—shockingly
ADD
so.
ADD
They
ADD
have
ADD
their
ADD
knives
ADD
into
ADD
one
ADD
another,
ADD
too.
ADD
They
ADD
are
ADD
as
ADD
jealous
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
pair
ADD
of
ADD
professional
ADD
beauties.
ADD
There
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
some
ADD
fun
ADD
over
ADD
this
ADD
case
ADD
if
ADD
they
ADD
are
ADD
both
ADD
put
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
scent.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
amazed
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
calm
ADD
way
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
rippled
ADD
on.
ADD
“Surely
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
moment
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
lost,”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
“shall
ADD
I
ADD
go
ADD
and
ADD
order
ADD
you
ADD
a
ADD
cab?”
ADD

ADD
“I’m
ADD
not
ADD
sure
ADD
about
ADD
whether
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
go.
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
incurably
ADD
lazy
ADD
devil
ADD
that
ADD
ever
ADD
stood
ADD
in
ADD
shoe
ADD
leather—that
ADD
is,
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
fit
ADD
is
ADD
on
ADD
me,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
be
ADD
spry
ADD
enough
ADD
at
ADD
times.”
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
just
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
chance
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
longing
ADD
for.”
ADD

ADD
“My
ADD
dear
ADD
fellow,
ADD
what
ADD
does
ADD
it
ADD
matter
ADD
to
ADD
me.
ADD
Supposing
ADD
I
ADD
unravel
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
matter,
ADD
you
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
sure
ADD
that
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
and
ADD
Co.
ADD
will
ADD
pocket
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
credit.
ADD
That
ADD
comes
ADD
of
ADD
being
ADD
an
ADD
unofficial
ADD
personage.”
ADD

ADD
“But
ADD
he
ADD
begs
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
help
ADD
him.”
ADD

ADD
“Yes.
ADD
He
ADD
knows
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
his
ADD
superior,
ADD
and
ADD
acknowledges
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
me;
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
cut
ADD
his
ADD
tongue
ADD
out
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
own
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
any
ADD
third
ADD
person.
ADD
However,
ADD
we
ADD
may
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
go
ADD
and
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
look.
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
work
ADD
it
ADD
out
ADD
on
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
hook.
ADD
I
ADD
may
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
laugh
ADD
at
ADD
them
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
nothing
ADD
else.
ADD
Come
ADD
on!”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
hustled
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
overcoat,
ADD
and
ADD
bustled
ADD
about
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
way
ADD
that
ADD
showed
ADD
that
ADD
an
ADD
energetic
ADD
fit
ADD
had
ADD
superseded
ADD
the
ADD
apathetic
ADD
one.
ADD

ADD
“Get
ADD
your
ADD
hat,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
wish
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
come?”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
nothing
ADD
better
ADD
to
ADD
do.”
ADD
A
ADD
minute
ADD
later
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
both
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
hansom,
ADD
driving
ADD
furiously
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
foggy,
ADD
cloudy
ADD
morning,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
dun-coloured
ADD
veil
ADD
hung
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
house-tops,
ADD
looking
ADD
like
ADD
the
ADD
reflection
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mud-coloured
ADD
streets
ADD
beneath.
ADD
My
ADD
companion
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
best
ADD
of
ADD
spirits,
ADD
and
ADD
prattled
ADD
away
ADD
about
ADD
Cremona
ADD
fiddles,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
difference
ADD
between
ADD
a
ADD
Stradivarius
ADD
and
ADD
an
ADD
Amati.
ADD
As
ADD
for
ADD
myself,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
silent,
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
dull
ADD
weather
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
melancholy
ADD
business
ADD
upon
ADD
which
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
engaged,
ADD
depressed
ADD
my
ADD
spirits.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
don’t
ADD
seem
ADD
to
ADD
give
ADD
much
ADD
thought
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
matter
ADD
in
ADD
hand,”
ADD
I
ADD
said
ADD
at
ADD
last,
ADD
interrupting
ADD
Holmes’
ADD
musical
ADD
disquisition.
ADD

ADD
“No
ADD
data
ADD
yet,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
capital
ADD
mistake
ADD
to
ADD
theorize
ADD
before
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
evidence.
ADD
It
ADD
biases
ADD
the
ADD
judgment.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
will
ADD
have
ADD
your
ADD
data
ADD
soon,”
ADD
I
ADD
remarked,
ADD
pointing
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
finger;
ADD
“this
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
house,
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
not
ADD
very
ADD
much
ADD
mistaken.”
ADD

ADD
“So
ADD
it
ADD
is.
ADD
Stop,
ADD
driver,
ADD
stop!”
ADD
We
ADD
were
ADD
still
ADD
a
ADD
hundred
ADD
yards
ADD
or
ADD
so
ADD
from
ADD
it,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
insisted
ADD
upon
ADD
our
ADD
alighting,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
finished
ADD
our
ADD
journey
ADD
upon
ADD
foot.
ADD

ADD
Number
ADD
3,
ADD
Lauriston
ADD
Gardens
ADD
wore
ADD
an
ADD
ill-omened
ADD
and
ADD
minatory
ADD
look.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
four
ADD
which
ADD
stood
ADD
back
ADD
some
ADD
little
ADD
way
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
street,
ADD
two
ADD
being
ADD
occupied
ADD
and
ADD
two
ADD
empty.
ADD
The
ADD
latter
ADD
looked
ADD
out
ADD
with
ADD
three
ADD
tiers
ADD
of
ADD
vacant
ADD
melancholy
ADD
windows,
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
blank
ADD
and
ADD
dreary,
ADD
save
ADD
that
ADD
here
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
a
ADD
“To
ADD
Let”
ADD
card
ADD
had
ADD
developed
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
cataract
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
bleared
ADD
panes.
ADD
A
ADD
small
ADD
garden
ADD
sprinkled
ADD
over
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
scattered
ADD
eruption
ADD
of
ADD
sickly
ADD
plants
ADD
separated
ADD
each
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
houses
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
street,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
traversed
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
narrow
ADD
pathway,
ADD
yellowish
ADD
in
ADD
colour,
ADD
and
ADD
consisting
ADD
apparently
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
mixture
ADD
of
ADD
clay
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
gravel.
ADD
The
ADD
whole
ADD
place
ADD
was
ADD
very
ADD
sloppy
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
rain
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
fallen
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
night.
ADD
The
ADD
garden
ADD
was
ADD
bounded
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
three-foot
ADD
brick
ADD
wall
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
fringe
ADD
of
ADD
wood
ADD
rails
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
top,
ADD
and
ADD
against
ADD
this
ADD
wall
ADD
was
ADD
leaning
ADD
a
ADD
stalwart
ADD
police
ADD
constable,
ADD
surrounded
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
knot
ADD
of
ADD
loafers,
ADD
who
ADD
craned
ADD
their
ADD
necks
ADD
and
ADD
strained
ADD
their
ADD
eyes
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
vain
ADD
hope
ADD
of
ADD
catching
ADD
some
ADD
glimpse
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
proceedings
ADD
within.
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
imagined
ADD
that
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
would
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
have
ADD
hurried
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
and
ADD
plunged
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
study
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mystery.
ADD
Nothing
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
further
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
intention.
ADD
With
ADD
an
ADD
air
ADD
of
ADD
nonchalance
ADD
which,
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
circumstances,
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
border
ADD
upon
ADD
affectation,
ADD
he
ADD
lounged
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
pavement,
ADD
and
ADD
gazed
ADD
vacantly
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
ground,
ADD
the
ADD
sky,
ADD
the
ADD
opposite
ADD
houses
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
line
ADD
of
ADD
railings.
ADD
Having
ADD
finished
ADD
his
ADD
scrutiny,
ADD
he
ADD
proceeded
ADD
slowly
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
path,
ADD
or
ADD
rather
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
fringe
ADD
of
ADD
grass
ADD
which
ADD
flanked
ADD
the
ADD
path,
ADD
keeping
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
riveted
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
ground.
ADD
Twice
ADD
he
ADD
stopped,
ADD
and
ADD
once
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
him
ADD
smile,
ADD
and
ADD
heard
ADD
him
ADD
utter
ADD
an
ADD
exclamation
ADD
of
ADD
satisfaction.
ADD
There
ADD
were
ADD
many
ADD
marks
ADD
of
ADD
footsteps
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wet
ADD
clayey
ADD
soil,
ADD
but
ADD
since
ADD
the
ADD
police
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
coming
ADD
and
ADD
going
ADD
over
ADD
it,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
unable
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
how
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
could
ADD
hope
ADD
to
ADD
learn
ADD
anything
ADD
from
ADD
it.
ADD
Still
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
had
ADD
such
ADD
extraordinary
ADD
evidence
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
quickness
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
perceptive
ADD
faculties,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
doubt
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
deal
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
hidden
ADD
from
ADD
me.
ADD

ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
met
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
tall,
ADD
white-faced,
ADD
flaxen-haired
ADD
man,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
notebook
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
hand,
ADD
who
ADD
rushed
ADD
forward
ADD
and
ADD
wrung
ADD
my
ADD
companion’s
ADD
hand
ADD
with
ADD
effusion.
ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
indeed
ADD
kind
ADD
of
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
come,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
everything
ADD
left
ADD
untouched.”
ADD

ADD
“Except
ADD
that!”
ADD
my
ADD
friend
ADD
answered,
ADD
pointing
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
pathway.
ADD
“If
ADD
a
ADD
herd
ADD
of
ADD
buffaloes
ADD
had
ADD
passed
ADD
along
ADD
there
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
greater
ADD
mess.
ADD
No
ADD
doubt,
ADD
however,
ADD
you
ADD
had
ADD
drawn
ADD
your
ADD
own
ADD
conclusions,
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
before
ADD
you
ADD
permitted
ADD
this.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
so
ADD
much
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
inside
ADD
the
ADD
house,”
ADD
the
ADD
detective
ADD
said
ADD
evasively.
ADD
“My
ADD
colleague,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
is
ADD
here.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
relied
ADD
upon
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
look
ADD
after
ADD
this.”
ADD

ADD
Holmes
ADD
glanced
ADD
at
ADD
me
ADD
and
ADD
raised
ADD
his
ADD
eyebrows
ADD
sardonically.
ADD
“With
ADD
two
ADD
such
ADD
men
ADD
as
ADD
yourself
ADD
and
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
ground,
ADD
there
ADD
will
ADD
not
ADD
be
ADD
much
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
third
ADD
party
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
out,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD

ADD
Gregson
ADD
rubbed
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
self-satisfied
ADD
way.
ADD
“I
ADD
think
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
done
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
can
ADD
be
ADD
done,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered;
ADD
“it’s
ADD
a
ADD
queer
ADD
case
ADD
though,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
your
ADD
taste
ADD
for
ADD
such
ADD
things.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
come
ADD
here
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
cab?”
ADD
asked
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD

ADD
“No,
ADD
sir.”
ADD

ADD
“Nor
ADD
Lestrade?”
ADD

ADD
“No,
ADD
sir.”
ADD

ADD
“Then
ADD
let
ADD
us
ADD
go
ADD
and
ADD
look
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
room.”
ADD
With
ADD
which
ADD
inconsequent
ADD
remark
ADD
he
ADD
strode
ADD
on
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
house,
ADD
followed
ADD
by
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
whose
ADD
features
ADD
expressed
ADD
his
ADD
astonishment.
ADD

ADD
A
ADD
short
ADD
passage,
ADD
bare
ADD
planked
ADD
and
ADD
dusty,
ADD
led
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
kitchen
ADD
and
ADD
offices.
ADD
Two
ADD
doors
ADD
opened
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
left
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
right.
ADD
One
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
had
ADD
obviously
ADD
been
ADD
closed
ADD
for
ADD
many
ADD
weeks.
ADD
The
ADD
other
ADD
belonged
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
dining-room,
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
apartment
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
mysterious
ADD
affair
ADD
had
ADD
occurred.
ADD
Holmes
ADD
walked
ADD
in,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
followed
ADD
him
ADD
with
ADD
that
ADD
subdued
ADD
feeling
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
heart
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
presence
ADD
of
ADD
death
ADD
inspires.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
square
ADD
room,
ADD
looking
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
larger
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
absence
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
furniture.
ADD
A
ADD
vulgar
ADD
flaring
ADD
paper
ADD
adorned
ADD
the
ADD
walls,
ADD
but
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
blotched
ADD
in
ADD
places
ADD
with
ADD
mildew,
ADD
and
ADD
here
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
great
ADD
strips
ADD
had
ADD
become
ADD
detached
ADD
and
ADD
hung
ADD
down,
ADD
exposing
ADD
the
ADD
yellow
ADD
plaster
ADD
beneath.
ADD
Opposite
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
showy
ADD
fireplace,
ADD
surmounted
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
mantelpiece
ADD
of
ADD
imitation
ADD
white
ADD
marble.
ADD
On
ADD
one
ADD
corner
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
was
ADD
stuck
ADD
the
ADD
stump
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
red
ADD
wax
ADD
candle.
ADD
The
ADD
solitary
ADD
window
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
dirty
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
light
ADD
was
ADD
hazy
ADD
and
ADD
uncertain,
ADD
giving
ADD
a
ADD
dull
ADD
grey
ADD
tinge
ADD
to
ADD
everything,
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
intensified
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
thick
ADD
layer
ADD
of
ADD
dust
ADD
which
ADD
coated
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
apartment.
ADD

ADD
All
ADD
these
ADD
details
ADD
I
ADD
observed
ADD
afterwards.
ADD
At
ADD
present
ADD
my
ADD
attention
ADD
was
ADD
centred
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
single
ADD
grim
ADD
motionless
ADD
figure
ADD
which
ADD
lay
ADD
stretched
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
boards,
ADD
with
ADD
vacant
ADD
sightless
ADD
eyes
ADD
staring
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
discoloured
ADD
ceiling.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
about
ADD
forty-three
ADD
or
ADD
forty-four
ADD
years
ADD
of
ADD
age,
ADD
middle-sized,
ADD
broad
ADD
shouldered,
ADD
with
ADD
crisp
ADD
curling
ADD
black
ADD
hair,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
short
ADD
stubbly
ADD
beard.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
dressed
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
heavy
ADD
broadcloth
ADD
frock
ADD
coat
ADD
and
ADD
waistcoat,
ADD
with
ADD
light-coloured
ADD
trousers,
ADD
and
ADD
immaculate
ADD
collar
ADD
and
ADD
cuffs.
ADD
A
ADD
top
ADD
hat,
ADD
well
ADD
brushed
ADD
and
ADD
trim,
ADD
was
ADD
placed
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
floor
ADD
beside
ADD
him.
ADD
His
ADD
hands
ADD
were
ADD
clenched
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
arms
ADD
thrown
ADD
abroad,
ADD
while
ADD
his
ADD
lower
ADD
limbs
ADD
were
ADD
interlocked
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
his
ADD
death
ADD
struggle
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
grievous
ADD
one.
ADD
On
ADD
his
ADD
rigid
ADD
face
ADD
there
ADD
stood
ADD
an
ADD
expression
ADD
of
ADD
horror,
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
of
ADD
hatred,
ADD
such
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
never
ADD
seen
ADD
upon
ADD
human
ADD
features.
ADD
This
ADD
malignant
ADD
and
ADD
terrible
ADD
contortion,
ADD
combined
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
low
ADD
forehead,
ADD
blunt
ADD
nose,
ADD
and
ADD
prognathous
ADD
jaw
ADD
gave
ADD
the
ADD
dead
ADD
man
ADD
a
ADD
singularly
ADD
simious
ADD
and
ADD
ape-like
ADD
appearance,
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
increased
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
writhing,
ADD
unnatural
ADD
posture.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
seen
ADD
death
ADD
in
ADD
many
ADD
forms,
ADD
but
ADD
never
ADD
has
ADD
it
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
more
ADD
fearsome
ADD
aspect
ADD
than
ADD
in
ADD
that
ADD
dark
ADD
grimy
ADD
apartment,
ADD
which
ADD
looked
ADD
out
ADD
upon
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
main
ADD
arteries
ADD
of
ADD
suburban
ADD
London.
ADD

ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
lean
ADD
and
ADD
ferret-like
ADD
as
ADD
ever,
ADD
was
ADD
standing
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
doorway,
ADD
and
ADD
greeted
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
and
ADD
myself.
ADD

ADD
“This
ADD
case
ADD
will
ADD
make
ADD
a
ADD
stir,
ADD
sir,”
ADD
he
ADD
remarked.
ADD
“It
ADD
beats
ADD
anything
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
seen,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
no
ADD
chicken.”
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
clue?”
ADD
said
ADD
Gregson.
ADD

ADD
“None
ADD
at
ADD
all,”
ADD
chimed
ADD
in
ADD
Lestrade.
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
approached
ADD
the
ADD
body,
ADD
and,
ADD
kneeling
ADD
down,
ADD
examined
ADD
it
ADD
intently.
ADD
“You
ADD
are
ADD
sure
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
wound?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked,
ADD
pointing
ADD
to
ADD
numerous
ADD
gouts
ADD
and
ADD
splashes
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
which
ADD
lay
ADD
all
ADD
round.
ADD

ADD
“Positive!”
ADD
cried
ADD
both
ADD
detectives.
ADD

ADD
“Then,
ADD
of
ADD
course,
ADD
this
ADD
blood
ADD
belongs
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
second
ADD
individual—8
ADD
presumably
ADD
the
ADD
murderer,
ADD
if
ADD
murder
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
committed.
ADD
It
ADD
reminds
ADD
me
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
circumstances
ADD
attendant
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
Van
ADD
Jansen,
ADD
in
ADD
Utrecht,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
year
ADD
‘34.
ADD
Do
ADD
you
ADD
remember
ADD
the
ADD
case,
ADD
Gregson?”
ADD

ADD
“No,
ADD
sir.”
ADD

ADD
“Read
ADD
it
ADD
up—you
ADD
really
ADD
should.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
nothing
ADD
new
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
sun.
ADD
It
ADD
has
ADD
all
ADD
been
ADD
done
ADD
before.”
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
his
ADD
nimble
ADD
fingers
ADD
were
ADD
flying
ADD
here,
ADD
there,
ADD
and
ADD
everywhere,
ADD
feeling,
ADD
pressing,
ADD
unbuttoning,
ADD
examining,
ADD
while
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
wore
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
far-away
ADD
expression
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
already
ADD
remarked
ADD
upon.
ADD
So
ADD
swiftly
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
examination
ADD
made,
ADD
that
ADD
one
ADD
would
ADD
hardly
ADD
have
ADD
guessed
ADD
the
ADD
minuteness
ADD
with
ADD
which
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
conducted.
ADD
Finally,
ADD
he
ADD
sniffed
ADD
the
ADD
dead
ADD
man’s
ADD
lips,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
glanced
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
soles
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
patent
ADD
leather
ADD
boots.
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
has
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
moved
ADD
at
ADD
all?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“No
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
was
ADD
necessary
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
purposes
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
examination.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
can
ADD
take
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
mortuary
ADD
now,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“There
ADD
is
ADD
nothing
ADD
more
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
learned.”
ADD

ADD
Gregson
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
stretcher
ADD
and
ADD
four
ADD
men
ADD
at
ADD
hand.
ADD
At
ADD
his
ADD
call
ADD
they
ADD
entered
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
stranger
ADD
was
ADD
lifted
ADD
and
ADD
carried
ADD
out.
ADD
As
ADD
they
ADD
raised
ADD
him,
ADD
a
ADD
ring
ADD
tinkled
ADD
down
ADD
and
ADD
rolled
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
floor.
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
grabbed
ADD
it
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
stared
ADD
at
ADD
it
ADD
with
ADD
mystified
ADD
eyes.
ADD

ADD
“There’s
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
woman
ADD
here,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried.
ADD
“It’s
ADD
a
ADD
woman’s
ADD
wedding-ring.”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
held
ADD
it
ADD
out,
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
palm
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
hand.
ADD
We
ADD
all
ADD
gathered
ADD
round
ADD
him
ADD
and
ADD
gazed
ADD
at
ADD
it.
ADD
There
ADD
could
ADD
be
ADD
no
ADD
doubt
ADD
that
ADD
that
ADD
circlet
ADD
of
ADD
plain
ADD
gold
ADD
had
ADD
once
ADD
adorned
ADD
the
ADD
finger
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
bride.
ADD

ADD
“This
ADD
complicates
ADD
matters,”
ADD
said
ADD
Gregson.
ADD
“Heaven
ADD
knows,
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
complicated
ADD
enough
ADD
before.”
ADD

ADD
“You’re
ADD
sure
ADD
it
ADD
doesn’t
ADD
simplify
ADD
them?”
ADD
observed
ADD
Holmes.
ADD
“There’s
ADD
nothing
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
learned
ADD
by
ADD
staring
ADD
at
ADD
it.
ADD
What
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
find
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
pockets?”
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
have
ADD
it
ADD
all
ADD
here,”
ADD
said
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
pointing
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
litter
ADD
of
ADD
objects
ADD
upon
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
bottom
ADD
steps
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
stairs.

ADD

ADD
“At

what

address?”
ADD

ADD
“American

ADD
Strand—to

be
ADD
left

They

and

refer
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
sailing
ADD
of

their

from

ADD
It

is
ADD
clear
ADD
that
ADD
this
ADD
unfortunate
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
about
ADD
to

return

ADD

ADD
“Have

you
ADD
made

any

inquiries
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
man,
ADD
Stangerson?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
did
ADD
it
ADD
at
ADD
once,
ADD
sir,”
ADD
said
ADD
Gregson.
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
advertisements
ADD
sent
ADD
to
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
newspapers,
ADD
and
ADD
one
ADD
of

my
ADD
men
ADD
has
ADD
gone
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
American
ADD
Exchange,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
not

returned
ADD
yet.”
ADD

ADD
“Have
ADD
you
ADD
sent
ADD
to
ADD
Cleveland?”
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
telegraphed
ADD
this
ADD
morning.”
ADD

ADD
“How
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
word
ADD
your
ADD
inquiries?”
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
simply
ADD
detailed
ADD
the
ADD
circumstances,
ADD
and
ADD
said
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
glad
ADD
of
ADD
any
ADD
information
ADD
which
ADD
could
ADD
help
ADD
us.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
ask
ADD
for
ADD
particulars
ADD
on
ADD
any
ADD
point
ADD
which
ADD
appeared
ADD
to

you
ADD
to

ADD

ADD
“I

asked

about

Stangerson.”
ADD

ADD
“Nothing

else?
ADD
Is
ADD
there
ADD
no
ADD
circumstance
ADD
on
ADD
which
ADD
this

whole

case

appears
ADD
to

hinge?
ADD
Will
ADD
you
ADD
not

telegraph
ADD
again?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
said
ADD
all
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
to
ADD
say,”
ADD
said
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
offended
ADD
voice.
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
chuckled
ADD
to
ADD
himself,
ADD
and
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
about
ADD
to
ADD
make
ADD
some
ADD
remark,
ADD
when
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
front
ADD
room
ADD
while
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
holding
ADD
this
ADD
conversation
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
hall,
ADD
reappeared
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
scene,
ADD
rubbing
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
pompous
ADD
and
ADD
self-satisfied
ADD
manner.
ADD

ADD
“Mr.
ADD
Gregson,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
just
ADD
made
ADD
a
ADD
discovery
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
highest
ADD
importance,
ADD
and
ADD
one
ADD
which
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
overlooked
ADD
had
ADD
I
ADD
not
ADD
made
ADD
a
ADD
careful
ADD
examination
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
walls.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
little
ADD
man’s
ADD
eyes
ADD
sparkled
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
evidently
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
state
ADD
of
ADD
suppressed
ADD
exultation
ADD
at
ADD
having
ADD
scored
ADD
a
ADD
point
ADD
against
ADD
his
ADD
colleague.
ADD

ADD
“Come
ADD
here,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
bustling
ADD
back
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
the
ADD
atmosphere
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
felt
ADD
clearer
ADD
since
ADD
the
ADD
removal
ADD
of
ADD
its
ADD
ghastly
ADD
inmate.
ADD
“Now,
ADD
stand
ADD
there!”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
struck
ADD
a
ADD
match
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
boot
ADD
and
ADD
held
ADD
it
ADD
up
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
wall.
ADD

ADD
“Look
ADD
at
ADD
that!”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
triumphantly.
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
remarked
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
paper
ADD
had
ADD
fallen
ADD
away
ADD
in
ADD
parts.
ADD
In
ADD
this
ADD
particular
ADD
corner
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
piece
ADD
had
ADD
peeled
ADD
off,
ADD
leaving
ADD
a
ADD
yellow
ADD
square
ADD
of
ADD
coarse
ADD
plastering.
ADD
Across
ADD
this
ADD
bare
ADD
space
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
scrawled
ADD
in
ADD
blood-red
ADD
letters
ADD
a
ADD
single
ADD
word—
ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD
RACHE.
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
that?”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
detective,
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
air
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
showman
ADD
exhibiting
ADD
his
ADD
show.
ADD
“This
ADD
was
ADD
overlooked
ADD
because
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
darkest
ADD
corner
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
and
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
looking
ADD
there.
ADD
The
ADD
murderer
ADD
has
ADD
written
ADD
it
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
or
ADD
her
ADD
own
ADD
blood.
ADD
See
ADD
this
ADD
smear
ADD
where
ADD
it
ADD
has
ADD
trickled
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
wall!
ADD
That
ADD
disposes
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
idea
ADD
of
ADD
suicide
ADD
anyhow.
ADD
Why
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
corner
ADD
chosen
ADD
to
ADD
write
ADD
it
ADD
on?
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
tell
ADD
you.
ADD
See
ADD
that
ADD
candle
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
mantelpiece.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
lit
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
time,
ADD
and
ADD
if
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
lit
ADD
this
ADD
corner
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
brightest
ADD
instead
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
darkest
ADD
portion
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
wall.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
what
ADD
does
ADD
it
ADD
mean
ADD
now
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
found
ADD
it?”
ADD
asked
ADD
Gregson
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
depreciatory
ADD
voice.
ADD

ADD
“Mean?
ADD
Why,
ADD
it
ADD
means
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
writer
ADD
was
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
the
ADD
female
ADD
name
ADD
Rachel,
ADD
but
ADD
was
ADD
disturbed
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
or
ADD
she
ADD
had
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
finish.
ADD
You
ADD
mark
ADD
my
ADD
words,
ADD
when
ADD
this
ADD
case
ADD
comes
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
cleared
ADD
up
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
find
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
woman
ADD
named
ADD
Rachel
ADD
has
ADD
something
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
with
ADD
it.
ADD
It’s
ADD
all
ADD
very
ADD
well
ADD
for
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
laugh,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD
You
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
very
ADD
smart
ADD
and
ADD
clever,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
hound
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
best,
ADD
when
ADD
all
ADD
is
ADD
said
ADD
and
ADD
done.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
really
ADD
beg
ADD
your
ADD
pardon!”
ADD
said
ADD
my
ADD
companion,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
ruffled
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
man’s
ADD
temper
ADD
by
ADD
bursting
ADD
into
ADD
an
ADD
explosion
ADD
of
ADD
laughter.
ADD
“You
ADD
certainly
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
credit
ADD
of
ADD
being
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
of
ADD
us
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
this
ADD
out,
ADD
and,
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
say,
ADD
it
ADD
bears
ADD
every
ADD
mark
ADD
of
ADD
having
ADD
been
ADD
written
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
participant
ADD
in
ADD
last
ADD
night’s
ADD
mystery.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
not
ADD
had
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
examine
ADD
this
ADD
room
ADD
yet,
ADD
but
ADD
with
ADD
your
ADD
permission
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
do
ADD
so
ADD
now.”
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
he
ADD
whipped
ADD
a
ADD
tape
ADD
measure
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
round
ADD
magnifying
ADD
glass
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
pocket.
ADD
With
ADD
these
ADD
two
ADD
implements
ADD
he
ADD
trotted
ADD
noiselessly
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
sometimes
ADD
stopping,
ADD
occasionally
ADD
kneeling,
ADD
and
ADD
once
ADD
lying
ADD
flat
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
face.
ADD
So
ADD
engrossed
ADD
was
ADD
he
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
occupation
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
forgotten
ADD
our
ADD
presence,
ADD
for
ADD
he
ADD
chattered
ADD
away
ADD
to
ADD
himself
ADD
under
ADD
his
ADD
breath
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
time,
ADD
keeping
ADD
up
ADD
a
ADD
running
ADD
fire
ADD
of
ADD
exclamations,
ADD
groans,
ADD
whistles,
ADD
and
ADD
little
ADD
cries
ADD
suggestive
ADD
of
ADD
encouragement
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
hope.
ADD
As
ADD
I
ADD
watched
ADD
him
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
irresistibly
ADD
reminded
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
pure-blooded
ADD
well-trained
ADD
foxhound
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
dashes
ADD
backwards
ADD
and
ADD
forwards
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
covert,
ADD
whining
ADD
in
ADD
its
ADD
eagerness,
ADD
until
ADD
it
ADD
comes
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
lost
ADD
scent.
ADD
For
ADD
twenty
ADD
minutes
ADD
or
ADD
more
ADD
he
ADD
continued
ADD
his
ADD
researches,
ADD
measuring
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
exact
ADD
care
ADD
the
ADD
distance
ADD
between
ADD
marks
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
entirely
ADD
invisible
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
occasionally
ADD
applying
ADD
his
ADD
tape
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
walls
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
equally
ADD
incomprehensible
ADD
manner.
ADD
In
ADD
one
ADD
place
ADD
he
ADD
gathered
ADD
up
ADD
very
ADD
carefully
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
pile
ADD
of
ADD
grey
ADD
dust
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
floor,
ADD
and
ADD
packed
ADD
it
ADD
away
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
envelope.
ADD
Finally,
ADD
he
ADD
examined
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
glass
ADD
the
ADD
word
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wall,
ADD
going
ADD
over
ADD
every
ADD
letter
ADD
of
ADD
it
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
minute
ADD
exactness.
ADD
This
ADD
done,
ADD
he
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
satisfied,
ADD
for
ADD
he
ADD
replaced
ADD
his
ADD
tape
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
glass
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
pocket.
ADD

ADD
“They
ADD
say
ADD
that
ADD
genius
ADD
is
ADD
an
ADD
infinite
ADD
capacity
ADD
for
ADD
taking
ADD
pains,”
ADD
he
ADD
remarked
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
smile.
ADD
“It’s
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
bad
ADD
definition,
ADD
but
ADD
it
ADD
does
ADD
apply
ADD
to
ADD
detective
ADD
work.”
ADD

ADD
Gregson
ADD
and
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
had
ADD
watched
ADD
the
ADD
manoeuvres
ADD
9
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
amateur
ADD
companion
ADD
with
ADD
considerable
ADD
curiosity
ADD
and
ADD
some
ADD
contempt.
ADD
They
ADD
evidently
ADD
failed
ADD
to
ADD
appreciate
ADD
the
ADD
fact,
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
begun
ADD
to
ADD
realize,
ADD
that
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes’
ADD
smallest
ADD
actions
ADD
were
ADD
all
ADD
directed
ADD
towards
ADD
some
ADD
definite
ADD
and
ADD
practical
ADD
end.
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
it,
ADD
sir?”
ADD
they
ADD
both
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
robbing
ADD
you
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
credit
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
presume
ADD
to
ADD
help
ADD
you,”
ADD
remarked
ADD
my
ADD
friend.
ADD
“You
ADD
are
ADD
doing
ADD
so
ADD
well
ADD
now
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
pity
ADD
for
ADD
anyone
ADD
to
ADD
interfere.”
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
world
ADD
of
ADD
sarcasm
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
voice
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke.
ADD
“If
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
let
ADD
me
ADD
know
ADD
how
ADD
your
ADD
investigations
ADD
go,”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
“I
ADD
shall
ADD
be
ADD
happy
ADD
to
ADD
give
ADD
you
ADD
any
ADD
help
ADD
I
ADD
can.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
meantime
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
like
ADD
to
ADD
speak
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
constable
ADD
who
ADD
found
ADD
the
ADD
body.
ADD
Can
ADD
you
ADD
give
ADD
me
ADD
his
ADD
name
ADD
and
ADD
address?”
ADD

ADD
Lestrade
ADD
glanced
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
note-book.
ADD
“John
ADD
Rance,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“He
ADD
is
ADD
off
ADD
duty
ADD
now.
ADD
You
ADD
will
ADD
find
ADD
him
ADD
at
ADD
46,
ADD
Audley
ADD
Court,
ADD
Kennington
ADD
Park
ADD
Gate.”
ADD

ADD
Holmes
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
note
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
address.
ADD

ADD
“Come
ADD
along,
ADD
Doctor,”
ADD
he
ADD
said;
ADD
“we
ADD
shall
ADD
go
ADD
and
ADD
look
ADD
him
ADD
up.
ADD
I’ll
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
one
ADD
thing
ADD
which
ADD
may
ADD
help
ADD
you
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
case,”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
turning
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
detectives.
ADD
“There
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
murder
ADD
done,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
murderer
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
man.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
six
ADD
feet
ADD
high,
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
prime
ADD
of
ADD
life,
ADD
had
ADD
small
ADD
feet
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
height,
ADD
wore
ADD
coarse,
ADD
square-toed
ADD
boots
ADD
and
ADD
smoked
ADD
a
ADD
Trichinopoly
ADD
cigar.
ADD
He
ADD
came
ADD
here
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
victim
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
four-wheeled
ADD
cab,
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
drawn
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
horse
ADD
with
ADD
three
ADD
old
ADD
shoes
ADD
and
ADD
one
ADD
new
ADD
one
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
off
ADD
fore
ADD
leg.
ADD
In
ADD
all
ADD
probability
ADD
the
ADD
murderer
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
florid
ADD
face,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
finger-nails
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
right
ADD
hand
ADD
were
ADD
remarkably
ADD
long.
ADD
These
ADD
are
ADD
only
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
indications,
ADD
but
ADD
they
ADD
may
ADD
assist
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
Lestrade
ADD
and
ADD
Gregson
ADD
glanced
ADD
at
ADD
each
ADD
other
ADD
with
ADD
an
ADD
incredulous
ADD
smile.
ADD

ADD
“If
ADD
this
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
murdered,
ADD
how
ADD
was
ADD
it
ADD
done?”
ADD
asked
ADD
the
ADD
former.
ADD

ADD
“Poison,”
ADD
said
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
curtly,
ADD
and
ADD
strode
ADD
off.
ADD
“One
ADD
other
ADD
thing,
ADD
Lestrade,”
ADD
he
ADD
added,
ADD
turning
ADD
round
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
door:
ADD
“‘Rache,’
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
German
ADD
for
ADD
‘revenge;’
ADD
so
ADD
don’t
ADD
lose
ADD
your
ADD
time
ADD
looking
ADD
for
ADD
Miss
ADD
Rachel.”
ADD

ADD
With
ADD
which
ADD
Parthian
ADD
shot
ADD
he
ADD
walked
ADD
away,
ADD
leaving
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
rivals
ADD
open-mouthed
ADD
behind
ADD
him.
ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
IV.
ADD
WHAT
ADD
JOHN
ADD
RANCE
ADD
HAD
ADD
TO
ADD
TELL.
ADD

ADD
IT
ADD
was
ADD
one
ADD
o’clock
ADD
when
ADD
we
ADD
left
ADD
No.
ADD
3,
ADD
Lauriston
ADD
Gardens.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
led
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
nearest
ADD
telegraph
ADD
office,
ADD
whence
ADD
he
ADD
dispatched
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
telegram.
ADD
He
ADD
then
ADD
hailed
ADD
a
ADD
cab,
ADD
and
ADD
ordered
ADD
the
ADD
driver
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
us
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
address
ADD
given
ADD
us
ADD
by
ADD
Lestrade.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
is
ADD
nothing
ADD
like
ADD
first
ADD
hand
ADD
evidence,”
ADD
he
ADD
remarked;
ADD
“as
ADD
a
ADD
matter
ADD
of
ADD
fact,
ADD
my
ADD
mind
ADD
is
ADD
entirely
ADD
made
ADD
up
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
case,
ADD
but
ADD
still
ADD
we
ADD
may
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
learn
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
is
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
learned.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
amaze
ADD
me,
ADD
Holmes,”
ADD
said
ADD
I.
ADD
“Surely
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
not
ADD
as
ADD
sure
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
pretend
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
those
ADD
particulars
ADD
which
ADD
you
ADD
gave.”
ADD

ADD
“There’s
ADD
no
ADD
room
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
mistake,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD
“The
ADD
very
ADD
first
ADD
thing
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
observed
ADD
on
ADD
arriving
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
cab
ADD
had
ADD
made
ADD
two
ADD
ruts
ADD
with
ADD
its
ADD
wheels
ADD
close
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
curb.
ADD
Now,
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
last
ADD
night,
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
rain
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
week,
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
those
ADD
wheels
ADD
which
ADD
left
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
deep
ADD
impression
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
there
ADD
during
ADD
the
ADD
night.
ADD
There
ADD
were
ADD
the
ADD
marks
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
horse’s
ADD
hoofs,
ADD
too,
ADD
the
ADD
outline
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
far
ADD
more
ADD
clearly
ADD
cut
ADD
than
ADD
that
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
three,
ADD
showing
ADD
that
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
new
ADD
shoe.
ADD
Since
ADD
the
ADD
cab
ADD
was
ADD
there
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
rain
ADD
began,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
there
ADD
at
ADD
any
ADD
time
ADD
during
ADD
the
ADD
morning—I
ADD
have
ADD
Gregson’s
ADD
word
ADD
for
ADD
that—it
ADD
follows
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
there
ADD
during
ADD
the
ADD
night,
ADD
and,
ADD
therefore,
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
brought
ADD
those
ADD
two
ADD
individuals
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
house.”
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
seems
ADD
simple
ADD
enough,”
ADD
said
ADD
I;
ADD
“but
ADD
how
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
man’s
ADD
height?”
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
the
ADD
height
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
man,
ADD
in
ADD
nine
ADD
cases
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
ten,
ADD
can
ADD
be
ADD
told
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
length
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
stride.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
simple
ADD
calculation
ADD
enough,
ADD
though
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
use
ADD
my
ADD
boring
ADD
you
ADD
with
ADD
figures.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
this
ADD
fellow’s
ADD
stride
ADD
both
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
clay
ADD
outside
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
dust
ADD
within.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
way
ADD
of
ADD
checking
ADD
my
ADD
calculation.
ADD
When
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
writes
ADD
on
ADD
a
ADD
wall,
ADD
his
ADD
instinct
ADD
leads
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
write
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
level
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
eyes.
ADD
Now
ADD
that
ADD
writing
ADD
was
ADD
just
ADD
over
ADD
six
ADD
feet
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
ground.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
child’s
ADD
play.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
his
ADD
age?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Well,
ADD
if
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
can
ADD
stride
ADD
four
ADD
and
ADD
a-half
ADD
feet
ADD
without
ADD
the
ADD
smallest
ADD
effort,
ADD
he
ADD
can’t
ADD
be
ADD
quite
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
sere
ADD
and
ADD
yellow.
ADD
That
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
breadth
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
puddle
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
garden
ADD
walk
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
evidently
ADD
walked
ADD
across.
ADD
Patent-leather
ADD
boots
ADD
had
ADD
gone
ADD
round,
ADD
and
ADD
Square-toes
ADD
had
ADD
hopped
ADD
over.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
mystery
ADD
about
ADD
it
ADD
at
ADD
all.
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
simply
ADD
applying
ADD
to
ADD
ordinary
ADD
life
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
precepts
ADD
of
ADD
observation
ADD
and
ADD
deduction
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
advocated
ADD
in
ADD
that
ADD
article.
ADD
Is
ADD
there
ADD
anything
ADD
else
ADD
that
ADD
puzzles
ADD
you?”
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
finger
ADD
nails
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
Trichinopoly,”
ADD
I
ADD
suggested.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
writing
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
wall
ADD
was
ADD
done
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
man’s
ADD
forefinger
ADD
dipped
ADD
in
ADD
blood.
ADD
My
ADD
glass
ADD
allowed
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
observe
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
plaster
ADD
was
ADD
slightly
ADD
scratched
ADD
in
ADD
doing
ADD
it,
ADD
which
ADD
would
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
if
ADD
the
ADD
man’s
ADD
nail
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
trimmed.
ADD
I
ADD
gathered
ADD
up
ADD
some
ADD
scattered
ADD
ash
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
floor.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
dark
ADD
in
ADD
colour
ADD
and
ADD
flakey—such
ADD
an
ADD
ash
ADD
as
ADD
is
ADD
only
ADD
made
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
Trichinopoly.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
made
ADD
a
ADD
special
ADD
study
ADD
of
ADD
cigar
ADD
ashes—in
ADD
fact,
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
written
ADD
a
ADD
monograph
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
subject.
ADD
I
ADD
flatter
ADD
myself
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
distinguish
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
glance
ADD
the
ADD
ash
ADD
of
ADD
any
ADD
known
ADD
brand,
ADD
either
ADD
of
ADD
cigar
ADD
or
ADD
of
ADD
tobacco.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
just
ADD
in
ADD
such
ADD
details
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
skilled
ADD
detective
ADD
differs
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
Gregson
ADD
and
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
type.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
the
ADD
florid
ADD
face?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Ah,
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
more
ADD
daring
ADD
shot,
ADD
though
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
doubt
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
right.
ADD
You
ADD
must
ADD
not
ADD
ask
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
present
ADD
state
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
affair.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
passed
ADD
my
ADD
hand
ADD
over
ADD
my
ADD
brow.
ADD
“My
ADD
head
ADD
is
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
whirl,”
ADD
I
ADD
remarked;
ADD
“the
ADD
more
ADD
one
ADD
thinks
ADD
of
ADD
it
ADD
the
ADD
more
ADD
mysterious
ADD
it
ADD
grows.
ADD
How
ADD
came
ADD
these
ADD
two
ADD
men—if
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
two
ADD
men—into
ADD
an
ADD
empty
ADD
house?
ADD
What
ADD
has
ADD
become
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
cabman
ADD
who
ADD
drove
ADD
them?
ADD
How
ADD
could
ADD
one
ADD
man
ADD
compel
ADD
another
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
poison?
ADD
Where
ADD
did
ADD
the
ADD
blood
ADD
come
ADD
from?
ADD
What
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
object
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
murderer,
ADD
since
ADD
robbery
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
part
ADD
in
ADD
it?
ADD
How
ADD
came
ADD
the
ADD
woman’s
ADD
ring
ADD
there?
ADD
Above
ADD
all,
ADD
why
ADD
should
ADD
the
ADD
second
ADD
man
ADD
write
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
German
ADD
word
ADD
RACHE
ADD
before
ADD
decamping?
ADD
I
ADD
confess
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
cannot
ADD
see
ADD
any
ADD
possible
ADD
way
ADD
of
ADD
reconciling
ADD
all
ADD
these
ADD
facts.”
ADD

ADD
My
ADD
companion
ADD
smiled
ADD
approvingly.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
sum
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
difficulties
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
situation
ADD
succinctly
ADD
and
ADD
well,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“There
ADD
is
ADD
much
ADD
that
ADD
is
ADD
still
ADD
obscure,
ADD
though
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
quite
ADD
made
ADD
up
ADD
my
ADD
mind
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
main
ADD
facts.
ADD
As
ADD
to
ADD
poor
ADD
Lestrade’s
ADD
discovery
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
simply
ADD
a
ADD
blind
ADD
intended
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
the
ADD
police
ADD
upon
ADD
a
ADD
wrong
ADD
track,
ADD
by
ADD
suggesting
ADD
Socialism
ADD
and
ADD
secret
ADD
societies.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
done
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
German.
ADD
The
ADD
A,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
noticed,
ADD
was
ADD
printed
ADD
somewhat
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
German
ADD
fashion.
ADD
Now,
ADD
a
ADD
real
ADD
German
ADD
invariably
ADD
prints
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Latin
ADD
character,
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
may
ADD
safely
ADD
say
ADD
that
ADD
this
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
written
ADD
by
ADD
one,
ADD
but
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
clumsy
ADD
imitator
ADD
who
ADD
overdid
ADD
his
ADD
part.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
simply
ADD
a
ADD
ruse
ADD
to
ADD
divert
ADD
inquiry
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
wrong
ADD
channel.
ADD
I’m
ADD
not
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
much
ADD
more
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
case,
ADD
Doctor.
ADD
You
ADD
know
ADD
a
ADD
conjuror
ADD
gets
ADD
no
ADD
credit
ADD
when
ADD
once
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
explained
ADD
his
ADD
trick,
ADD
and
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
show
ADD
you
ADD
too
ADD
much
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
method
ADD
of
ADD
working,
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
conclusion
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
ordinary
ADD
individual
ADD
after
ADD
all.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
shall
ADD
never
ADD
do
ADD
that,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered;
ADD
“you
ADD
have
ADD
brought
ADD
detection
ADD
as
ADD
near
ADD
an
ADD
exact
ADD
science
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
ever
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
brought
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
world.”
ADD

ADD
My
ADD
companion
ADD
flushed
ADD
up
ADD
with
ADD
pleasure
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
words,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
earnest
ADD
way
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
uttered
ADD
them.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
observed
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
as
ADD
sensitive
ADD
to
ADD
flattery
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
score
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
art
ADD
as
ADD
any
ADD
girl
ADD
could
ADD
be
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
beauty.
ADD

ADD
“I’ll
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
one
ADD
other
ADD
thing,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“Patent
ADD
leathers
ADD
10
ADD
and
ADD
Square-toes
ADD
came
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
cab,
ADD
and
ADD
they
ADD
walked
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
pathway
ADD
together
ADD
as
ADD
friendly
ADD
as
ADD
possible—arm-in-arm,
ADD
in
ADD
all
ADD
probability.
ADD
When
ADD
they
ADD
got
ADD
inside
ADD
they
ADD
walked
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
room—or
ADD
rather,
ADD
Patent-leathers
ADD
stood
ADD
still
ADD
while
ADD
Square-toes
ADD
walked
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
down.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
read
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
dust;
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
read
ADD
that
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
walked
ADD
he
ADD
grew
ADD
more
ADD
and
ADD
more
ADD
excited.
ADD
That
ADD
is
ADD
shown
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
increased
ADD
length
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
strides.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
talking
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
while,
ADD
and
ADD
working
ADD
himself
ADD
up,
ADD
no
ADD
doubt,
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
fury.
ADD
Then
ADD
the
ADD
tragedy
ADD
occurred.
ADD
I’ve
ADD
told
ADD
you
ADD
all
ADD
I
ADD
know
ADD
myself
ADD
now,
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
rest
ADD
is
ADD
mere
ADD
surmise
ADD
and
ADD
conjecture.
ADD
We
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
good
ADD
working
ADD
basis,
ADD
however,
ADD
on
ADD
which
ADD
to
ADD
start.
ADD
We
ADD
must
ADD
hurry
ADD
up,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
want
ADD
to
ADD
go
ADD
to
ADD
Halle’s
ADD
concert
ADD
to
ADD
hear
ADD
Norman
ADD
Neruda
ADD
this
ADD
afternoon.”
ADD

ADD
This
ADD
conversation
ADD
had
ADD
occurred
ADD
while
ADD
our
ADD
cab
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
threading
ADD
its
ADD
way
ADD
through
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
succession
ADD
of
ADD
dingy
ADD
streets
ADD
and
ADD
dreary
ADD
by-ways.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
dingiest
ADD
and
ADD
dreariest
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
our
ADD
driver
ADD
suddenly
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
stand.
ADD
“That’s
ADD
Audley
ADD
Court
ADD
in
ADD
there,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
pointing
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
narrow
ADD
slit
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
line
ADD
of
ADD
dead-coloured
ADD
brick.
ADD
“You’ll
ADD
find
ADD
me
ADD
here
ADD
when
ADD
you
ADD
come
ADD
back.”
ADD

ADD
Audley
ADD
Court
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
an
ADD
attractive
ADD
locality.
ADD
The
ADD
narrow
ADD
passage
ADD
led
ADD
us
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
quadrangle
ADD
paved
ADD
with
ADD
flags
ADD
and
ADD
lined
ADD
by
ADD
sordid
ADD
dwellings.
ADD
We
ADD
picked
ADD
our
ADD
way
ADD
among
ADD
groups
ADD
of
ADD
dirty
ADD
children,
ADD
and
ADD
through
ADD
lines
ADD
of
ADD
discoloured
ADD
linen,
ADD
until
ADD
we
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
Number
ADD
46,
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
decorated
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
slip
ADD
of
ADD
brass
ADD
on
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
Rance
ADD
was
ADD
engraved.
ADD
On
ADD
enquiry
ADD
we
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
constable
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
bed,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
shown
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
front
ADD
parlour
ADD
to
ADD
await
ADD
his
ADD
coming.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
appeared
ADD
presently,
ADD
looking
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
irritable
ADD
at
ADD
being
ADD
disturbed
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
slumbers.
ADD
“I
ADD
made
ADD
my
ADD
report
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
office,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD

ADD
Holmes
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
half-sovereign
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
pocket
ADD
and
ADD
played
ADD
with
ADD
it
ADD
pensively.
ADD
“We
ADD
thought
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
should
ADD
like
ADD
to
ADD
hear
ADD
it
ADD
all
ADD
from
ADD
your
ADD
own
ADD
lips,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
shall
ADD
be
ADD
most
ADD
happy
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
anything
ADD
I
ADD
can,”
ADD
the
ADD
constable
ADD
answered
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
golden
ADD
disk.
ADD

ADD
“Just
ADD
let
ADD
us
ADD
hear
ADD
it
ADD
all
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
own
ADD
way
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
occurred.”
ADD

ADD
Rance
ADD
sat
ADD
down
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
horsehair
ADD
sofa,
ADD
and
ADD
knitted
ADD
his
ADD
brows
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
determined
ADD
not
ADD
to
ADD
omit
ADD
anything
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
narrative.
ADD

ADD
“I’ll
ADD
tell
ADD
it
ADD
ye
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
beginning,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“My
ADD
time
ADD
is
ADD
from
ADD
ten
ADD
at
ADD
night
ADD
to
ADD
six
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
morning.
ADD
At
ADD
eleven
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
fight
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
‘White
ADD
Hart’;
ADD
but
ADD
bar
ADD
that
ADD
all
ADD
was
ADD
quiet
ADD
enough
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
beat.
ADD
At
ADD
one
ADD
o’clock
ADD
it
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
rain,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
met
ADD
Harry
ADD
Murcher—him
ADD
who
ADD
has
ADD
the
ADD
Holland
ADD
Grove
ADD
beat—and
ADD
we
ADD
stood
ADD
together
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
corner
ADD
of
ADD
Henrietta
ADD
Street
ADD
a-talkin’.
ADD
Presently—maybe
ADD
about
ADD
two
ADD
or
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
after—I
ADD
thought
ADD
I
ADD
would
ADD
take
ADD
a
ADD
look
ADD
round
ADD
and
ADD
see
ADD
that
ADD
all
ADD
was
ADD
right
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
precious
ADD
dirty
ADD
and
ADD
lonely.
ADD
Not
ADD
a
ADD
soul
ADD
did
ADD
I
ADD
meet
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
way
ADD
down,
ADD
though
ADD
a
ADD
cab
ADD
or
ADD
two
ADD
went
ADD
past
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
strollin’
ADD
down,
ADD
thinkin’
ADD
between
ADD
ourselves
ADD
how
ADD
uncommon
ADD
handy
ADD
a
ADD
four
ADD
of
ADD
gin
ADD
hot
ADD
would
ADD
be,
ADD
when
ADD
suddenly
ADD
the
ADD
glint
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
light
ADD
caught
ADD
my
ADD
eye
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
window
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
same
ADD
house.
ADD
Now,
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
them
ADD
two
ADD
houses
ADD
in
ADD
Lauriston
ADD
Gardens
ADD
was
ADD
empty
ADD
on
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
owns
ADD
them
ADD
who
ADD
won’t
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
drains
ADD
seen
ADD
to,
ADD
though
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
last
ADD
tenant
ADD
what
ADD
lived
ADD
in
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
died
ADD
o’
ADD
typhoid
ADD
fever.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
knocked
ADD
all
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
heap
ADD
therefore
ADD
at
ADD
seeing
ADD
a
ADD
light
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
window,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
suspected
ADD
as
ADD
something
ADD
was
ADD
wrong.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
got
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
door——”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
stopped,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
walked
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
garden
ADD
gate,”
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
interrupted.
ADD
“What
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
do
ADD
that
ADD
for?”
ADD

ADD
Rance
ADD
gave
ADD
a
ADD
violent
ADD
jump,
ADD
and
ADD
stared
ADD
at
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
utmost
ADD
amazement
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
features.
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
that’s
ADD
true,
ADD
sir,”
ADD
he
ADD
said;
ADD
“though
ADD
how
ADD
you
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
it,
ADD
Heaven
ADD
only
ADD
knows.
ADD
Ye
ADD
see,
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
got
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
still
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
lonesome,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
I’d
ADD
be
ADD
none
ADD
the
ADD
worse
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
one
ADD
with
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
ain’t
ADD
afeared
ADD
of
ADD
anything
ADD
on
ADD
this
ADD
side
ADD
o’
ADD
the
ADD
grave;
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
that
ADD
maybe
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
died
ADD
o’
ADD
the
ADD
typhoid
ADD
inspecting
ADD
the
ADD
drains
ADD
what
ADD
killed
ADD
him.
ADD
The
ADD
thought
ADD
gave
ADD
me
ADD
a
ADD
kind
ADD
o’
ADD
turn,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
walked
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
gate
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
Murcher’s
ADD
lantern,
ADD
but
ADD
there
ADD
wasn’t
ADD
no
ADD
sign
ADD
of
ADD
him
ADD
nor
ADD
of
ADD
anyone
ADD
else.”
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
street?”
ADD

ADD
“Not
ADD
a
ADD
livin’
ADD
soul,
ADD
sir,
ADD
nor
ADD
as
ADD
much
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
dog.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
pulled
ADD
myself
ADD
together
ADD
and
ADD
went
ADD
back
ADD
and
ADD
pushed
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
open.
ADD
All
ADD
was
ADD
quiet
ADD
inside,
ADD
so
ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
where
ADD
the
ADD
light
ADD
was
ADD
a-burnin’.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
candle
ADD
flickerin’
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
mantelpiece—a
ADD
red
ADD
wax
ADD
one—and
ADD
by
ADD
its
ADD
light
ADD
I
ADD
saw——”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
I
ADD
know
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
saw.
ADD
You
ADD
walked
ADD
round
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
several
ADD
times,
ADD
and
ADD
you
ADD
knelt
ADD
down
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
body,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
you
ADD
walked
ADD
through
ADD
and
ADD
tried
ADD
the
ADD
kitchen
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
then——”
ADD

ADD
John
ADD
Rance
ADD
sprang
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
feet
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
frightened
ADD
face
ADD
and
ADD
suspicion
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
eyes.
ADD
“Where
ADD
was
ADD
you
ADD
hid
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
all
ADD
that?”
ADD
he
ADD
cried.
ADD
“It
ADD
seems
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
knows
ADD
a
ADD
deal
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
you
ADD
should.”
ADD

ADD
Holmes
ADD
laughed
ADD
and
ADD
threw
ADD
his
ADD
card
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
table
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
constable.
ADD
“Don’t
ADD
get
ADD
arresting
ADD
me
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
murder,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“I
ADD
am
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
hounds
ADD
and
ADD
not
ADD
the
ADD
wolf;
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Gregson
ADD
or
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
will
ADD
answer
ADD
for
ADD
that.
ADD
Go
ADD
on,
ADD
though.
ADD
What
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
do
ADD
next?”
ADD

ADD
Rance
ADD
resumed
ADD
his
ADD
seat,
ADD
without
ADD
however
ADD
losing
ADD
his
ADD
mystified
ADD
expression.
ADD
“I
ADD
went
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
gate
ADD
and
ADD
sounded
ADD
my
ADD
whistle.
ADD
That
ADD
brought
ADD
Murcher
ADD
and
ADD
two
ADD
more
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
spot.”
ADD

ADD
“Was
ADD
the
ADD
street
ADD
empty
ADD
then?”
ADD

ADD
“Well,
ADD
it
ADD
was,
ADD
as
ADD
far
ADD
as
ADD
anybody
ADD
that
ADD
could
ADD
be
ADD
of
ADD
any
ADD
good
ADD
goes.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
mean?”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
constable’s
ADD
features
ADD
broadened
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
grin.
ADD
“I’ve
ADD
seen
ADD
many
ADD
a
ADD
drunk
ADD
chap
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
time,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“but
ADD
never
ADD
anyone
ADD
so
ADD
cryin’
ADD
drunk
ADD
as
ADD
that
ADD
cove.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
gate
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
came
ADD
out,
ADD
a-leanin’
ADD
up
ADD
agin
ADD
the
ADD
railings,
ADD
and
ADD
a-singin’
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
pitch
ADD
o’
ADD
his
ADD
lungs
ADD
about
ADD
Columbine’s
ADD
New-fangled
ADD
Banner,
ADD
or
ADD
some
ADD
such
ADD
stuff.
ADD
He
ADD
couldn’t
ADD
stand,
ADD
far
ADD
less
ADD
help.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
sort
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
he?”
ADD
asked
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD

ADD
John
ADD
Rance
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
somewhat
ADD
irritated
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
digression.
ADD
“He
ADD
was
ADD
an
ADD
uncommon
ADD
drunk
ADD
sort
ADD
o’
ADD
man,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“He’d
ADD
ha’
ADD
found
ADD
hisself
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
station
ADD
if
ADD
we
ADD
hadn’t
ADD
been
ADD
so
ADD
took
ADD
up.”
ADD

ADD
“His
ADD
face—his
ADD
dress—didn’t
ADD
you
ADD
notice
ADD
them?”
ADD
Holmes
ADD
broke
ADD
in
ADD
impatiently.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
should
ADD
think
ADD
I
ADD
did
ADD
notice
ADD
them,
ADD
seeing
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
prop
ADD
him
ADD
up—me
ADD
and
ADD
Murcher
ADD
between
ADD
us.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
chap,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
red
ADD
face,
ADD
the
ADD
lower
ADD
part
ADD
muffled
ADD
round——”
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
will
ADD
do,”
ADD
cried
ADD
Holmes.
ADD
“What
ADD
became
ADD
of
ADD
him?”
ADD

ADD
“We’d
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
without
ADD
lookin’
ADD
after
ADD
him,”
ADD
the
ADD
policeman
ADD
said,
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
aggrieved
ADD
voice.
ADD
“I’ll
ADD
wager
ADD
he
ADD
found
ADD
his
ADD
way
ADD
home
ADD
all
ADD
right.”
ADD

ADD
“How
ADD
was
ADD
he
ADD
dressed?”
ADD

ADD
“A
ADD
brown
ADD
overcoat.”
ADD

ADD
“Had
ADD
he
ADD
a
ADD
whip
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
hand?”
ADD

ADD
“A
ADD
whip—no.”
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
left
ADD
it
ADD
behind,”
ADD
muttered
ADD
my
ADD
companion.
ADD
“You
ADD
didn’t
ADD
happen
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
or
ADD
hear
ADD
a
ADD
cab
ADD
after
ADD
that?”
ADD

ADD
“No.”
ADD

ADD
“There’s
ADD
a
ADD
half-sovereign
ADD
for
ADD
you,”
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
said,
ADD
standing
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
taking
ADD
his
ADD
hat.
ADD
“I
ADD
am
ADD
afraid,
ADD
Rance,
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
never
ADD
rise
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
force.
ADD
That
ADD
head
ADD
of
ADD
yours
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
for
ADD
use
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
as
ADD
ornament.
ADD
You
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
gained
ADD
your
ADD
sergeant’s
ADD
stripes
ADD
last
ADD
night.
ADD
The
ADD
man
ADD
whom
ADD
you
ADD
held
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
hands
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
holds
ADD
the
ADD
clue
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
mystery,
ADD
and
ADD
whom
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
seeking.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
use
ADD
of
ADD
arguing
ADD
about
ADD
it
ADD
now;
ADD
I
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
so.
ADD
Come
ADD
along,
ADD
Doctor.”
ADD

ADD
We
ADD
started
ADD
off
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
cab
ADD
together,
ADD
leaving
ADD
our
ADD
informant
ADD
incredulous,
ADD
but
ADD
obviously
ADD
uncomfortable.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
blundering
ADD
fool,”
ADD
Holmes
ADD
said,
ADD
bitterly,
ADD
as
ADD
we
ADD
drove
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
our
ADD
lodgings.
ADD
“Just
ADD
to
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
having
ADD
such
ADD
an
ADD
incomparable
ADD
bit
ADD
of
ADD
good
ADD
luck,
ADD
and
ADD
not
ADD
taking
ADD
advantage
ADD
of
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
am
ADD
rather
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
dark
ADD
still.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
true
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
description
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
man
ADD
tallies
ADD
with
ADD
your
ADD
idea
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
second
ADD
party
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
mystery.
ADD
But
ADD
why
ADD
should
ADD
he
ADD
come
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
after
ADD
leaving
ADD
it?
ADD
That
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
the
ADD
way
ADD
of
ADD
criminals.”
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
ring,
ADD
man,
ADD
the
ADD
ring:
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
back
ADD
for.
ADD
If
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
other
ADD
way
ADD
of
ADD
catching
ADD
him,
ADD
we
ADD
can
ADD
always
ADD
bait
ADD
our
ADD
line
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
ring.
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
have
ADD
him,
ADD
Doctor—I’ll
ADD
lay
ADD
you
ADD
two
ADD
to
ADD
one
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
him.
ADD
I
ADD
must
ADD
thank
ADD
you
ADD
for
ADD
it
ADD
all.
ADD
I
ADD
might
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
gone
ADD
but
ADD
for
ADD
you,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
have
ADD
missed
ADD
the
ADD
finest
ADD
study
ADD
I
ADD
ever
ADD
came
ADD
across:
ADD
a
ADD
study
ADD
in
ADD
scarlet,
ADD
eh?
ADD
Why
ADD
shouldn’t
ADD
we
ADD
use
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
art
ADD
jargon.
ADD
There’s
ADD
the
ADD
scarlet
ADD
thread
ADD
of
ADD
murder
ADD
running
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
colourless
ADD
skein
ADD
of
ADD
life,
ADD
and
ADD
our
ADD
duty
ADD
is
ADD
to
ADD
unravel
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
isolate
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
expose
ADD
every
ADD
inch
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
And
ADD
now
ADD
for
ADD
lunch,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
for
ADD
Norman
ADD
Neruda.
ADD
Her
ADD
attack
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
bowing
ADD
are
ADD
splendid.
ADD
What’s
ADD
that
ADD
little
ADD
thing
ADD
of
ADD
Chopin’s
ADD
she
ADD
plays
ADD
so
ADD
magnificently:
ADD
Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”
ADD

ADD
Leaning
ADD
back
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
cab,
ADD
this
ADD
amateur
ADD
bloodhound
ADD
carolled
ADD
away
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
lark
ADD
while
ADD
I
ADD
meditated
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
many-sidedness
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
human
ADD
mind.

ADD

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
V.
ADD
OUR
ADD
ADVERTISEMENT
ADD
BRINGS
ADD
A
ADD
VISITOR.
ADD

ADD
OUR
ADD
morning’s
ADD
exertions
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
too
ADD
much
ADD
for
ADD
my
ADD
weak
ADD
health,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
tired
ADD
out
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
afternoon.
ADD
After
ADD
Holmes’
ADD
departure
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
concert,
ADD
I
ADD
lay
ADD
down
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
sofa
ADD
and
ADD
endeavoured
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
a
ADD
couple
ADD
of
ADD
hours’
ADD
sleep.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
useless
ADD
attempt.
ADD
My
ADD
mind
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
too
ADD
much
ADD
excited
ADD
by
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
had
ADD
occurred,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
strangest
ADD
fancies
ADD
and
ADD
surmises
ADD
crowded
ADD
into
ADD
it.
ADD
Every
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
closed
ADD
my
ADD
eyes
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
before
ADD
me
ADD
the
ADD
distorted
ADD
baboon-like
ADD
countenance
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
murdered
ADD
man.
ADD
So
ADD
sinister
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
impression
ADD
which
ADD
that
ADD
face
ADD
had
ADD
produced
ADD
upon
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
it
ADD
difficult
ADD
to
ADD
feel
ADD
anything
ADD
but
ADD
gratitude
ADD
for
ADD
him
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
removed
ADD
its
ADD
owner
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
world.
ADD
If
ADD
ever
ADD
human
ADD
features
ADD
bespoke
ADD
vice
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
malignant
ADD
type,
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
certainly
ADD
those
ADD
of
ADD
Enoch
ADD
J.
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
of
ADD
Cleveland.
ADD
Still
ADD
I
ADD
recognized
ADD
that
ADD
justice
ADD
must
ADD
be
ADD
done,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
depravity
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
victim
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
condonment
ADD
11
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
eyes
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
law.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
more
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
it
ADD
the
ADD
more
ADD
extraordinary
ADD
did
ADD
my
ADD
companion’s
ADD
hypothesis,
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
poisoned,
ADD
appear.
ADD
I
ADD
remembered
ADD
how
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
sniffed
ADD
his
ADD
lips,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
doubt
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
detected
ADD
something
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
given
ADD
rise
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
idea.
ADD
Then,
ADD
again,
ADD
if
ADD
not
ADD
poison,
ADD
what
ADD
had
ADD
caused
ADD
the
ADD
man’s
ADD
death,
ADD
since
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
neither
ADD
wound
ADD
nor
ADD
marks
ADD
of
ADD
strangulation?
ADD
But,
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
hand,
ADD
whose
ADD
blood
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
which
ADD
lay
ADD
so
ADD
thickly
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
floor?
ADD
There
ADD
were
ADD
no
ADD
signs
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
struggle,
ADD
nor
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
victim
ADD
any
ADD
weapon
ADD
with
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
wounded
ADD
an
ADD
antagonist.
ADD
As
ADD
long
ADD
as
ADD
all
ADD
these
ADD
questions
ADD
were
ADD
unsolved,
ADD
I
ADD
felt
ADD
that
ADD
sleep
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
no
ADD
easy
ADD
matter,
ADD
either
ADD
for
ADD
Holmes
ADD
or
ADD
myself.
ADD
His
ADD
quiet
ADD
self-confident
ADD
manner
ADD
convinced
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
formed
ADD
a
ADD
theory
ADD
which
ADD
explained
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
facts,
ADD
though
ADD
what
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
for
ADD
an
ADD
instant
ADD
conjecture.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
very
ADD
late
ADD
in
ADD
returning—so
ADD
late,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
concert
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
detained
ADD
him
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
time.
ADD
Dinner
ADD
was
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
table
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
appeared.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
was
ADD
magnificent,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
took
ADD
his
ADD
seat.
ADD
“Do
ADD
you
ADD
remember
ADD
what
ADD
Darwin
ADD
says
ADD
about
ADD
music?
ADD
He
ADD
claims
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
power
ADD
of
ADD
producing
ADD
and
ADD
appreciating
ADD
it
ADD
existed
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
human
ADD
race
ADD
long
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
power
ADD
of
ADD
speech
ADD
was
ADD
arrived
ADD
at.
ADD
Perhaps
ADD
that
ADD
is
ADD
why
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
so
ADD
subtly
ADD
influenced
ADD
by
ADD
it.
ADD
There
ADD
are
ADD
vague
ADD
memories
ADD
in
ADD
our
ADD
souls
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
misty
ADD
centuries
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
world
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
its
ADD
childhood.”
ADD

ADD
“That’s
ADD
rather
ADD
a
ADD
broad
ADD
idea,”
ADD
I
ADD
remarked.
ADD

ADD
“One’s
ADD
ideas
ADD
must
ADD
be
ADD
as
ADD
broad
ADD
as
ADD
Nature
ADD
if
ADD
they
ADD
are
ADD
to
ADD
interpret
ADD
Nature,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD
“What’s
ADD
the
ADD
matter?
ADD
You’re
ADD
not
ADD
looking
ADD
quite
ADD
yourself.
ADD
This
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road
ADD
affair
ADD
has
ADD
upset
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
“To
ADD
tell
ADD
the
ADD
truth,
ADD
it
ADD
has,”
ADD
I
ADD
said.
ADD
“I
ADD
ought
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
more
ADD
case-hardened
ADD
after
ADD
my
ADD
Afghan
ADD
experiences.
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
comrades
ADD
hacked
ADD
to
ADD
pieces
ADD
at
ADD
Maiwand
ADD
without
ADD
losing
ADD
my
ADD
nerve.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
can
ADD
understand.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
mystery
ADD
about
ADD
this
ADD
which
ADD
stimulates
ADD
the
ADD
imagination;
ADD
where
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
imagination
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
horror.
ADD
Have
ADD
you
ADD
seen
ADD
the
ADD
evening
ADD
paper?”
ADD

ADD
“No.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
gives
ADD
a
ADD
fairly
ADD
good
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
affair.
ADD
It
ADD
does
ADD
not
ADD
mention
ADD
the
ADD
fact
ADD
that
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
raised
ADD
up,
ADD
a
ADD
woman’s
ADD
wedding
ADD
ring
ADD
fell
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
floor.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
just
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
it
ADD
does
ADD
not.”
ADD

ADD
“Why?”
ADD

ADD
“Look
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
advertisement,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD
“I
ADD
had
ADD
one
ADD
sent
ADD
to
ADD
every
ADD
paper
ADD
this
ADD
morning
ADD
immediately
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
affair.”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
threw
ADD
the
ADD
paper
ADD
across
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
glanced
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
place
ADD
indicated.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
announcement
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
“Found”
ADD
column.
ADD
“In
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road,
ADD
this
ADD
morning,”
ADD
it
ADD
ran,
ADD
“a
ADD
plain
ADD
gold
ADD
wedding
ADD
ring,
ADD
found
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
roadway
ADD
between
ADD
the
ADD
‘White
ADD
Hart’
ADD
Tavern
ADD
and
ADD
Holland
ADD
Grove.
ADD
Apply
ADD
Dr.
ADD
Watson,
ADD
221B,
ADD
Baker
ADD
Street,
ADD
between
ADD
eight
ADD
and
ADD
nine
ADD
this
ADD
evening.”
ADD

ADD
“Excuse
ADD
my
ADD
using
ADD
your
ADD
name,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“If
ADD
I
ADD
used
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
some
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
dunderheads
ADD
would
ADD
recognize
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
want
ADD
to
ADD
meddle
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
affair.”
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
is
ADD
all
ADD
right,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD
“But
ADD
supposing
ADD
anyone
ADD
applies,
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
ring.”
ADD

ADD
“Oh
ADD
yes,
ADD
you
ADD
have,”
ADD
said
ADD
he,
ADD
handing
ADD
me
ADD
one.
ADD
“This
ADD
will
ADD
do
ADD
very
ADD
well.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
almost
ADD
a
ADD
facsimile.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
who
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
expect
ADD
will
ADD
answer
ADD
this
ADD
advertisement.”
ADD

ADD
“Why,
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
brown
ADD
coat—our
ADD
florid
ADD
friend
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
square
ADD
toes.
ADD
If
ADD
he
ADD
does
ADD
not
ADD
come
ADD
himself
ADD
he
ADD
will
ADD
send
ADD
an
ADD
accomplice.”
ADD

ADD
“Would
ADD
he
ADD
not
ADD
consider
ADD
it
ADD
as
ADD
too
ADD
dangerous?”
ADD

ADD
“Not
ADD
at
ADD
all.
ADD
If
ADD
my
ADD
view
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
is
ADD
correct,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
every
ADD
reason
ADD
to
ADD
believe
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
is,
ADD
this
ADD
man
ADD
would
ADD
rather
ADD
risk
ADD
anything
ADD
than
ADD
lose
ADD
the
ADD
ring.
ADD
According
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
notion
ADD
he
ADD
dropped
ADD
it
ADD
while
ADD
stooping
ADD
over
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
body,
ADD
and
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
miss
ADD
it
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
time.
ADD
After
ADD
leaving
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
he
ADD
discovered
ADD
his
ADD
loss
ADD
and
ADD
hurried
ADD
back,
ADD
but
ADD
found
ADD
the
ADD
police
ADD
already
ADD
in
ADD
possession,
ADD
owing
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
folly
ADD
in
ADD
leaving
ADD
the
ADD
candle
ADD
burning.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
pretend
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
drunk
ADD
in
ADD
order
ADD
to
ADD
allay
ADD
the
ADD
suspicions
ADD
which
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
aroused
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
appearance
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
gate.
ADD
Now
ADD
put
ADD
yourself
ADD
in
ADD
that
ADD
man’s
ADD
place.
ADD
On
ADD
thinking
ADD
the
ADD
matter
ADD
over,
ADD
it
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
occurred
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
possible
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
lost
ADD
the
ADD
ring
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
after
ADD
leaving
ADD
the
ADD
house.
ADD
What
ADD
would
ADD
he
ADD
do,
ADD
then?
ADD
He
ADD
would
ADD
eagerly
ADD
look
ADD
out
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
evening
ADD
papers
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
hope
ADD
of
ADD
seeing
ADD
it
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
articles
ADD
found.
ADD
His
ADD
eye,
ADD
of
ADD
course,
ADD
would
ADD
light
ADD
upon
ADD
this.
ADD
He
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
overjoyed.
ADD
Why
ADD
should
ADD
he
ADD
fear
ADD
a
ADD
trap?
ADD
There
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
no
ADD
reason
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
why
ADD
the
ADD
finding
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
ring
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
connected
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
murder.
ADD
He
ADD
would
ADD
come.
ADD
He
ADD
will
ADD
come.
ADD
You
ADD
shall
ADD
see
ADD
him
ADD
within
ADD
an
ADD
hour?”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
then?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Oh,
ADD
you
ADD
can
ADD
leave
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
deal
ADD
with
ADD
him
ADD
then.
ADD
Have
ADD
you
ADD
any
ADD
arms?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
my
ADD
old
ADD
service
ADD
revolver
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
cartridges.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
had
ADD
better
ADD
clean
ADD
it
ADD
and
ADD
load
ADD
it.
ADD
He
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
desperate
ADD
man,
ADD
and
ADD
though
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
take
ADD
him
ADD
unawares,
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
ready
ADD
for
ADD
anything.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
bedroom
ADD
and
ADD
followed
ADD
his
ADD
advice.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
returned
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
pistol
ADD
the
ADD
table
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
cleared,
ADD
and
ADD
Holmes
ADD
was
ADD
engaged
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
favourite
ADD
occupation
ADD
of
ADD
scraping
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
violin.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
plot
ADD
thickens,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
entered;
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
just
ADD
had
ADD
an
ADD
answer
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
American
ADD
telegram.
ADD
My
ADD
view
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
correct
ADD
one.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
that
ADD
is?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
eagerly.
ADD

ADD
“My
ADD
fiddle
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
better
ADD
for
ADD
new
ADD
strings,”
ADD
he
ADD
remarked.
ADD
“Put
ADD
your
ADD
pistol
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
pocket.
ADD
When
ADD
the
ADD
fellow
ADD
comes
ADD
speak
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
ordinary
ADD
way.
ADD
Leave
ADD
the
ADD
rest
ADD
to
ADD
me.
ADD
Don’t
ADD
frighten
ADD
him
ADD
by
ADD
looking
ADD
at
ADD
him
ADD
too
ADD
hard.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
eight
ADD
o’clock
ADD
now,”
ADD
I
ADD
said,
ADD
glancing
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
watch.
ADD

ADD
“Yes.
ADD
He
ADD
will
ADD
probably
ADD
be
ADD
here
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
minutes.
ADD
Open
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
slightly.
ADD
That
ADD
will
ADD
do.
ADD
Now
ADD
put
ADD
the
ADD
key
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
inside.
ADD
Thank
ADD
you!
ADD
This
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
queer
ADD
old
ADD
book
ADD
I
ADD
picked
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
stall
ADD
yesterday—‘De
ADD
Jure
ADD
inter
ADD
Gentes’—published
ADD
in
ADD
Latin
ADD
at
ADD
Liege
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Lowlands,
ADD
in
ADD
1642.
ADD
Charles’
ADD
head
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
firm
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
shoulders
ADD
when
ADD
this
ADD
little
ADD
brown-backed
ADD
volume
ADD
was
ADD
struck
ADD
off.”
ADD

ADD
“Who
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
printer?”
ADD

ADD
“Philippe
ADD
de
ADD
Croy,
ADD
whoever
ADD
he
ADD
may
ADD
have
ADD
been.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
fly-leaf,
ADD
in
ADD
very
ADD
faded
ADD
ink,
ADD
is
ADD
written
ADD
‘Ex
ADD
libris
ADD
Guliolmi
ADD
Whyte.’
ADD
I
ADD
wonder
ADD
who
ADD
William
ADD
Whyte
ADD
was.
ADD
Some
ADD
pragmatical
ADD
seventeenth
ADD
century
ADD
lawyer,
ADD
I
ADD
suppose.
ADD
His
ADD
writing
ADD
has
ADD
a
ADD
legal
ADD
twist
ADD
about
ADD
it.
ADD
Here
ADD
comes
ADD
our
ADD
man,
ADD
I
ADD
think.”
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
spoke
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
sharp
ADD
ring
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
bell.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
rose
ADD
softly
ADD
and
ADD
moved
ADD
his
ADD
chair
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
direction
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
door.
ADD
We
ADD
heard
ADD
the
ADD
servant
ADD
pass
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
hall,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
sharp
ADD
click
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
latch
ADD
as
ADD
she
ADD
opened
ADD
it.
ADD

ADD
“Does
ADD
Dr.
ADD
Watson
ADD
live
ADD
here?”
ADD
asked
ADD
a
ADD
clear
ADD
but
ADD
rather
ADD
harsh
ADD
voice.
ADD
We
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
hear
ADD
the
ADD
servant’s
ADD
reply,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
closed,
ADD
and
ADD
some
ADD
one
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
ascend
ADD
the
ADD
stairs.
ADD
The
ADD
footfall
ADD
was
ADD
an
ADD
uncertain
ADD
and
ADD
shuffling
ADD
one.
ADD
A
ADD
look
ADD
of
ADD
surprise
ADD
passed
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
face
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
listened
ADD
to
ADD
it.
ADD
It
ADD
came
ADD
slowly
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
passage,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
feeble
ADD
tap
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
door.
ADD

ADD
“Come
ADD
in,”
ADD
I
ADD
cried.
ADD

ADD
At
ADD
my
ADD
summons,
ADD
instead
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
of
ADD
violence
ADD
whom
ADD
we
ADD
expected,
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
old
ADD
and
ADD
wrinkled
ADD
woman
ADD
hobbled
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
apartment.
ADD
She
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
dazzled
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
sudden
ADD
blaze
ADD
of
ADD
light,
ADD
and
ADD
after
ADD
dropping
ADD
a
ADD
curtsey,
ADD
she
ADD
stood
ADD
blinking
ADD
at
ADD
us
ADD
with
ADD
her
ADD
bleared
ADD
eyes
ADD
and
ADD
fumbling
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
pocket
ADD
with
ADD
nervous,
ADD
shaky
ADD
fingers.
ADD
I
ADD
glanced
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
companion,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
had
ADD
assumed
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
disconsolate
ADD
expression
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
all
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
do
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
my
ADD
countenance.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
old
ADD
crone
ADD
drew
ADD
out
ADD
an
ADD
evening
ADD
paper,
ADD
and
ADD
pointed
ADD
at
ADD
our
ADD
advertisement.
ADD
“It’s
ADD
this
ADD
as
ADD
has
ADD
brought
ADD
me,
ADD
good
ADD
gentlemen,”
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
dropping
ADD
another
ADD
curtsey;
ADD
“a
ADD
gold
ADD
wedding
ADD
ring
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road.
ADD
It
ADD
belongs
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
girl
ADD
Sally,
ADD
as
ADD
was
ADD
married
ADD
only
ADD
this
ADD
time
ADD
twelvemonth,
ADD
which
ADD
her
ADD
husband
ADD
is
ADD
steward
ADD
aboard
ADD
a
ADD
Union
ADD
boat,
ADD
and
ADD
what
ADD
he’d
ADD
say
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
come
ADD
‘ome
ADD
and
ADD
found
ADD
her
ADD
without
ADD
her
ADD
ring
ADD
is
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
think,
ADD
he
ADD
being
ADD
short
ADD
enough
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
best
ADD
o’
ADD
times,
ADD
but
ADD
more
ADD
especially
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
the
ADD
drink.
ADD
If
ADD
it
ADD
please
ADD
you,
ADD
she
ADD
went
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
circus
ADD
last
ADD
night
ADD
along
ADD
with——”
ADD

ADD
“Is
ADD
that
ADD
her
ADD
ring?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
Lord
ADD
be
ADD
thanked!”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
woman;
ADD
“Sally
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
glad
ADD
woman
ADD
this
ADD
night.
ADD
That’s
ADD
the
ADD
ring.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
what
ADD
may
ADD
your
ADD
address
ADD
be?”
ADD
I
ADD
inquired,
ADD
taking
ADD
up
ADD
a
ADD
pencil.
ADD

ADD
“13,
ADD
Duncan
ADD
Street,
ADD
Houndsditch.
ADD
A
ADD
weary
ADD
way
ADD
from
ADD
here.”
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road
ADD
does
ADD
not
ADD
lie
ADD
between
ADD
any
ADD
circus
ADD
and
ADD
Houndsditch,”
ADD
said
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
sharply.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
old
ADD
woman
ADD
faced
ADD
round
ADD
and
ADD
looked
ADD
keenly
ADD
at
ADD
him
ADD
from
ADD
her
ADD
little
ADD
red-rimmed
ADD
eyes.
ADD
“The
ADD
gentleman
ADD
asked
ADD
me
ADD
for
ADD
my
ADD
address,”
ADD
she
ADD
said.
ADD
“Sally
ADD
lives
ADD
in
ADD
lodgings
ADD
at
ADD
3,
ADD
Mayfield
ADD
Place,
ADD
Peckham.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
your
ADD
name
ADD
is——?”
ADD

ADD
“My
ADD
name
ADD
is
ADD
Sawyer—her’s
ADD
is
ADD
Dennis,
ADD
which
ADD
Tom
ADD
Dennis
ADD
married
ADD
her—and
ADD
a
ADD
smart,
ADD
clean
ADD
lad,
ADD
too,
ADD
as
ADD
long
ADD
as
ADD
he’s
ADD
at
ADD
sea,
ADD
and
ADD
no
ADD
steward
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
company
ADD
more
ADD
thought
ADD
of;
ADD
but
ADD
when
ADD
on
ADD
shore,
ADD
what
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
women
ADD
and
ADD
what
ADD
with
ADD
liquor
ADD
shops——”
ADD

ADD
“Here
ADD
is
ADD
your
ADD
ring,
ADD
Mrs.
ADD
Sawyer,”
ADD
I
ADD
interrupted,
ADD
in
ADD
obedience
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
sign
ADD
from
ADD
my
ADD
companion;
ADD
“it
ADD
clearly
ADD
belongs
ADD
to
ADD
your
ADD
daughter,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
glad
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
restore
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
rightful
ADD
owner.”
ADD

ADD
With
ADD
many
ADD
mumbled
ADD
blessings
ADD
and
ADD
protestations
ADD
of
ADD
gratitude
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
crone
ADD
packed
ADD
it
ADD
away
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
pocket,
ADD
and
ADD
shuffled
ADD
off
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
stairs.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
sprang
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
feet
ADD
the
ADD
moment
ADD
that
ADD
she
ADD
was
ADD
gone
ADD
and
ADD
rushed
ADD
into
ADD
his
ADD
room.
ADD
He
ADD
returned
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
seconds
ADD
enveloped
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
ulster
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
cravat.
ADD
“I’ll
ADD
follow
ADD
her,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
hurriedly;
ADD
“she
ADD
must
ADD
be
ADD
an
ADD
accomplice,
ADD
and
ADD
will
ADD
lead
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
Wait
ADD
up
ADD
for
ADD
me.”
ADD
The
ADD
hall
ADD
door
ADD
had
ADD
hardly
ADD
slammed
ADD
behind
ADD
our
ADD
visitor
ADD
before
ADD
Holmes
ADD
had
ADD
descended
ADD
the
ADD
stair.
ADD
Looking
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
window
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
her
ADD
walking
ADD
feebly
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
side,
ADD
while
ADD
her
ADD
pursuer
ADD
dogged
ADD
her
ADD
some
ADD
little
ADD
distance
ADD
behind.
ADD
“Either
ADD
his
ADD
whole
ADD
theory
ADD
is
ADD
incorrect,”
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
to
ADD
myself,
ADD
“or
ADD
else
ADD
he
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
led
ADD
now
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
heart
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mystery.”
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
need
ADD
for
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
ask
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
wait
ADD
up
ADD
for
ADD
him,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
felt
ADD
that
ADD
sleep
ADD
was
ADD
impossible
ADD
until
ADD
I
ADD
heard
ADD
the
ADD
result
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
adventure.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
close
ADD
upon
ADD
nine
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
set
ADD
out.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
idea
ADD
how
ADD
long
ADD
he
ADD
might
ADD
be,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
sat
ADD
stolidly
ADD
puffing
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
pipe
ADD
and
ADD
skipping
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
pages
ADD
of
ADD
Henri
ADD
Murger’s
ADD
“Vie
ADD
de
ADD
Bohème.”
ADD
Ten
ADD
o’clock
ADD
passed,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
heard
ADD
the
ADD
footsteps
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
maid
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
pattered
ADD
off
ADD
to
ADD
bed.
ADD
Eleven,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
more
ADD
stately
ADD
tread
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
landlady
ADD
passed
ADD
my
ADD
door,
ADD
bound
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
destination.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
close
ADD
upon
ADD
twelve
ADD
before
ADD
I
ADD
heard
ADD
the
ADD
sharp
ADD
sound
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
latch-key.
ADD
The
ADD
instant
ADD
he
ADD
entered
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
successful.
ADD
Amusement
ADD
and
ADD
chagrin
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
struggling
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
mastery,
ADD
until
ADD
the
ADD
former
ADD
suddenly
ADD
carried
ADD
the
ADD
day,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
burst
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
hearty
ADD
laugh.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
wouldn’t
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yarders
ADD
know
ADD
it
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
world,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
dropping
ADD
into
ADD
his
ADD
chair;
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
chaffed
ADD
them
ADD
so
ADD
much
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
would
ADD
never
ADD
have
ADD
let
ADD
me
ADD
hear
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
afford
ADD
to
ADD
laugh,
ADD
because
ADD
I
ADD
know
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
even
ADD
with
ADD
them
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
long
ADD
run.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
is
ADD
it
ADD
then?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Oh,
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
mind
ADD
telling
ADD
a
ADD
story
ADD
against
ADD
myself.
ADD
That
ADD
creature
ADD
had
ADD
gone
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
way
ADD
when
ADD
she
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
limp
ADD
and
ADD
show
ADD
every
ADD
sign
ADD
of
ADD
being
ADD
foot-sore.
ADD
Presently
ADD
she
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
halt,
ADD
and
ADD
hailed
ADD
a
ADD
four-wheeler
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
passing.
ADD
I
ADD
managed
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
close
ADD
to
ADD
her
ADD
so
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
hear
ADD
the
ADD
address,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
need
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
so
ADD
anxious,
ADD
for
ADD
she
ADD
sang
ADD
it
ADD
out
ADD
loud
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
heard
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
side
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
street,
ADD
‘Drive
ADD
to
ADD
13,
ADD
Duncan
ADD
Street,
ADD
Houndsditch,’
ADD
she
ADD
cried.
ADD
This
ADD
begins
ADD
to
ADD
look
ADD
genuine,
ADD
I
ADD
thought,
ADD
and
ADD
having
ADD
seen
ADD
her
ADD
safely
ADD
inside,
ADD
I
ADD
perched
ADD
myself
ADD
behind.
ADD
That’s
ADD
an
ADD
art
ADD
which
ADD
every
ADD
detective
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
an
ADD
expert
ADD
at.
ADD
Well,
ADD
away
ADD
we
ADD
rattled,
ADD
and
ADD
never
ADD
drew
ADD
rein
ADD
until
ADD
we
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
street
ADD
in
ADD
question.
ADD
I
ADD
hopped
ADD
off
ADD
before
ADD
we
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
strolled
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
street
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
easy,
ADD
lounging
ADD
way.
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
cab
ADD
pull
ADD
up.
ADD
The
ADD
driver
ADD
jumped
ADD
down,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
him
ADD
open
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
and
ADD
stand
ADD
expectantly.
ADD
Nothing
ADD
came
ADD
out
ADD
though.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
reached
ADD
him
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
groping
ADD
about
ADD
frantically
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
empty
ADD
cab,
ADD
and
ADD
giving
ADD
vent
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
finest
ADD
assorted
ADD
collection
ADD
of
ADD
oaths
ADD
that
ADD
ever
ADD
I
ADD
listened
ADD
to.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
sign
ADD
or
ADD
trace
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
passenger,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
fear
ADD
it
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
some
ADD
time
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
gets
ADD
his
ADD
fare.
ADD
On
ADD
inquiring
ADD
at
ADD
Number
ADD
13
ADD
we
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
belonged
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
respectable
ADD
paperhanger,
ADD
named
ADD
Keswick,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
either
ADD
of
ADD
Sawyer
ADD
or
ADD
Dennis
ADD
had
ADD
ever
ADD
been
ADD
heard
ADD
of
ADD
there.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
don’t
ADD
mean
ADD
to
ADD
say,”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
in
ADD
amazement,
ADD
“that
ADD
that
ADD
tottering,
ADD
feeble
ADD
old
ADD
woman
ADD
was
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
cab
ADD
while
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
motion,
ADD
without
ADD
either
ADD
you
ADD
or
ADD
the
ADD
driver
ADD
seeing
ADD
her?”
ADD

ADD
“Old
ADD
woman
ADD
be
ADD
damned!”
ADD
said
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
sharply.
ADD
“We
ADD
were
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
women
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
so
ADD
taken
ADD
in.
ADD
It
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
young
ADD
man,
ADD
and
ADD
an
ADD
active
ADD
one,
ADD
too,
ADD
besides
ADD
being
ADD
an
ADD
incomparable
ADD
actor.
ADD
The
ADD
get-up
ADD
was
ADD
inimitable.
ADD
He
ADD
saw
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
followed,
ADD
no
ADD
doubt,
ADD
and
ADD
used
ADD
this
ADD
means
ADD
of
ADD
giving
ADD
me
ADD
the
ADD
slip.
ADD
It
ADD
shows
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
after
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
as
ADD
lonely
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
imagined
ADD
he
ADD
was,
ADD
but
ADD
has
ADD
friends
ADD
who
ADD
are
ADD
ready
ADD
to
ADD
risk
ADD
something
ADD
for
ADD
him.
ADD
Now,
ADD
Doctor,
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
looking
ADD
done-up.
ADD
Take
ADD
my
ADD
advice
ADD
and
ADD
turn
ADD
in.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
certainly
ADD
feeling
ADD
very
ADD
weary,
ADD
so
ADD
I
ADD
obeyed
ADD
his
ADD
injunction.
ADD
I
ADD
left
ADD
Holmes
ADD
seated
ADD
in
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
smouldering
ADD
fire,
ADD
and
ADD
long
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
watches
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
night
ADD
I
ADD
heard
ADD
the
ADD
low,
ADD
melancholy
ADD
wailings
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
violin,
ADD
and
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
pondering
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
strange
ADD
problem
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
set
ADD
himself
ADD
to
ADD
unravel.

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
VI.
ADD
TOBIAS
ADD
GREGSON
ADD
SHOWS
ADD
WHAT
ADD
HE
ADD
CAN
ADD
DO.
ADD

ADD
THE
ADD
papers
ADD
next
ADD
day
ADD
were
ADD
full
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
“Brixton
ADD
Mystery,”
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
termed
ADD
it.
ADD
Each
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
affair,
ADD
and
ADD
some
ADD
had
ADD
leaders
ADD
upon
ADD
it
ADD
in
ADD
addition.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
some
ADD
information
ADD
in
ADD
them
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
new
ADD
to
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
still
ADD
retain
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
scrap-book
ADD
numerous
ADD
clippings
ADD
and
ADD
extracts
ADD
bearing
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
case.
ADD
Here
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
condensation
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
of
ADD
them:—
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
Daily
ADD
Telegraph
ADD
remarked
ADD
that
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
history
ADD
of
ADD
crime
ADD
there
ADD
had
ADD
seldom
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
tragedy
ADD
which
ADD
presented
ADD
stranger
ADD
features.
ADD
The
ADD
German
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
victim,
ADD
the
ADD
absence
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
other
ADD
motive,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
sinister
ADD
inscription
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
wall,
ADD
all
ADD
pointed
ADD
to
ADD
its
ADD
perpetration
ADD
by
ADD
political
ADD
refugees
ADD
and
ADD
revolutionists.
ADD
The
ADD
Socialists
ADD
had
ADD
many
ADD
branches
ADD
in
ADD
America,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
deceased
ADD
had,
ADD
no
ADD
doubt,
ADD
infringed
ADD
their
ADD
unwritten
ADD
laws,
ADD
and
ADD
been
ADD
tracked
ADD
down
ADD
by
ADD
them.
ADD
After
ADD
alluding
ADD
airily
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Vehmgericht,
ADD
aqua
ADD
tofana,
ADD
Carbonari,
ADD
the
ADD
Marchioness
ADD
de
ADD
Brinvilliers,
ADD
the
ADD
Darwinian
ADD
theory,
ADD
the
ADD
principles
ADD
of
ADD
Malthus,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
Ratcliff
ADD
Highway
ADD
murders,
ADD
the
ADD
article
ADD
concluded
ADD
by
ADD
admonishing
ADD
the
ADD
Government
ADD
and
ADD
advocating
ADD
a
ADD
closer
ADD
watch
ADD
over
ADD
foreigners
ADD
in
ADD
England.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
Standard
ADD
commented
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
fact
ADD
that
ADD
lawless
ADD
outrages
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
sort
ADD
usually
ADD
occurred
ADD
under
ADD
a
ADD
Liberal
ADD
Administration.
ADD
They
ADD
arose
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
unsettling
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
minds
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
masses,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
consequent
ADD
weakening
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
authority.
ADD
The
ADD
deceased
ADD
was
ADD
an
ADD
American
ADD
gentleman
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
residing
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
weeks
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Metropolis.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
stayed
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
boarding-house
ADD
of
ADD
Madame
ADD
Charpentier,
ADD
in
ADD
Torquay
ADD
Terrace,
ADD
Camberwell.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
accompanied
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
travels
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
private
ADD
secretary,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson.
ADD
The
ADD
two
ADD
bade
ADD
adieu
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
landlady
ADD
upon
ADD
Tuesday,
ADD
the
ADD
4th
ADD
inst.,
ADD
and
ADD
departed
ADD
to
ADD
Euston
ADD
Station
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
avowed
ADD
intention
ADD
of
ADD
catching
ADD
the
ADD
Liverpool
ADD
express.
ADD
They
ADD
were
ADD
afterwards
ADD
seen
ADD
together
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
platform.
ADD
Nothing
ADD
more
ADD
is
ADD
known
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
until
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
body
ADD
was,
ADD
as
ADD
recorded,
ADD
discovered
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
empty
ADD
house
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road,
ADD
many
ADD
miles
ADD
from
ADD
Euston.
ADD
How
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
there,
ADD
or
ADD
how
ADD
he
ADD
met
ADD
his
ADD
fate,
ADD
are
ADD
questions
ADD
which
ADD
are
ADD
still
ADD
involved
ADD
in
ADD
mystery.
ADD
Nothing
ADD
is
ADD
known
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
whereabouts
ADD
of
ADD
Stangerson.
ADD
We
ADD
are
ADD
glad
ADD
to
ADD
learn
ADD
that
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
and
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
of
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yard,
ADD
are
ADD
both
ADD
engaged
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
case,
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
confidently
ADD
anticipated
ADD
that
ADD
these
ADD
well-known
ADD
officers
ADD
will
ADD
speedily
ADD
throw
ADD
light
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
matter.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
Daily
ADD
News
ADD
observed
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
doubt
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
crime
ADD
being
ADD
a
ADD
political
ADD
one.
ADD
The
ADD
despotism
ADD
and
ADD
hatred
ADD
of
ADD
Liberalism
ADD
which
ADD
animated
ADD
the
ADD
Continental
ADD
Governments
ADD
had
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
effect
ADD
of
ADD
driving
ADD
to
ADD
our
ADD
shores
ADD
a
ADD
number
ADD
of
ADD
men
ADD
who
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
made
ADD
excellent
ADD
citizens
ADD
were
ADD
they
ADD
not
ADD
soured
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
recollection
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
undergone.
ADD
Among
ADD
these
ADD
men
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
stringent
ADD
code
ADD
of
ADD
honour,
ADD
any
ADD
infringement
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
punished
ADD
by
ADD
death.
ADD
Every
ADD
effort
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
made
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
the
ADD
secretary,
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
ascertain
ADD
some
ADD
particulars
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
habits
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
deceased.
ADD
A
ADD
great
ADD
step
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
gained
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
discovery
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
address
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
at
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
boarded—a
ADD
result
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
entirely
ADD
due
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
acuteness
ADD
and
ADD
energy
ADD
of
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Gregson
ADD
of
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yard.
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
read
ADD
these
ADD
notices
ADD
over
ADD
together
ADD
at
ADD
breakfast,
ADD
and
ADD
they
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
afford
ADD
him
ADD
considerable
ADD
amusement.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
told
ADD
you
ADD
that,
ADD
whatever
ADD
happened,
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
and
ADD
Gregson
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
sure
ADD
to
ADD
score.”
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
depends
ADD
on
ADD
how
ADD
it
ADD
turns
ADD
out.”
ADD

ADD
“Oh,
ADD
bless
ADD
you,
ADD
it
ADD
doesn’t
ADD
matter
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
least.
ADD
If
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
is
ADD
caught,
ADD
it
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
on
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
exertions;
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
escapes,
ADD
it
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
in
ADD
spite
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
exertions.
ADD
It’s
ADD
heads
ADD
I
ADD
win
ADD
and
ADD
tails
ADD
you
ADD
lose.
ADD
Whatever
ADD
they
ADD
do,
ADD
they
ADD
will
ADD
have
ADD
followers.

‘Un

ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
on
ADD
earth
ADD
is
ADD
this?”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
for
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
moment
ADD
there
ADD
came
ADD
the
ADD
pattering
ADD
of
ADD
many
ADD
steps
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
hall
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
stairs,
ADD
accompanied
ADD
by
ADD
audible
ADD
expressions
ADD
of
ADD
disgust
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
part
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
landlady.
ADD

ADD
“It’s
ADD
the
ADD
Baker
ADD
Street
ADD
division
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
detective
ADD
police
ADD
force,”
ADD
said
ADD
my
ADD
companion,
ADD
gravely;
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke
ADD
there
ADD
rushed
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
half
ADD
a
ADD
dozen
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
dirtiest
ADD
and
ADD
most
ADD
ragged
ADD
street
ADD
Arabs
ADD
that
ADD
ever
ADD
I
ADD
clapped
ADD
eyes
ADD
on.
ADD

ADD
“‘Tention!”
ADD
cried
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
sharp
ADD
tone,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
six
ADD
dirty
ADD
little
ADD
scoundrels
ADD
stood
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
line
ADD
like
ADD
so
ADD
many
ADD
disreputable
ADD
statuettes.
ADD
“In
ADD
future
ADD
you
ADD
shall
ADD
send
ADD
up
ADD
Wiggins
ADD
alone
ADD
to
ADD
report,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
rest
ADD
of
ADD
you
ADD
must
ADD
wait
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
street.
ADD
Have
ADD
you
ADD
found
ADD
it,
ADD
Wiggins?”
ADD

ADD
“No,
ADD
sir,
ADD
we
ADD
hain’t,”
ADD
said
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
youths.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
hardly
ADD
expected
ADD
you
ADD
would.
ADD
You
ADD
must
ADD
keep
ADD
on
ADD
until
ADD
you
ADD
do.
ADD
Here
ADD
are
ADD
your
ADD
wages.”
ADD
13
ADD
He
ADD
handed
ADD
each
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
a
ADD
shilling.
ADD

ADD
“Now,
ADD
off
ADD
you
ADD
go,
ADD
and
ADD
come
ADD
back
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
better
ADD
report
ADD
next
ADD
time.”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
waved
ADD
his
ADD
hand,
ADD
and
ADD
they
ADD
scampered
ADD
away
ADD
downstairs
ADD
like
ADD
so
ADD
many
ADD
rats,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
heard
ADD
their
ADD
shrill
ADD
voices
ADD
next
ADD
moment
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
street.
ADD

ADD
“There’s
ADD
more
ADD
work
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
got
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
little
ADD
beggars
ADD
than
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
dozen
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
force,”
ADD
Holmes
ADD
remarked.
ADD
“The
ADD
mere
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
official-looking
ADD
person
ADD
seals
ADD
men’s
ADD
lips.
ADD
These
ADD
youngsters,
ADD
however,
ADD
go
ADD
everywhere
ADD
and
ADD
hear
ADD
everything.
ADD
They
ADD
are
ADD
as
ADD
sharp
ADD
as
ADD
needles,
ADD
too;
ADD
all
ADD
they
ADD
want
ADD
is
ADD
organisation.”
ADD

ADD
“Is
ADD
it
ADD
on
ADD
this
ADD
Brixton
ADD
case
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
employing
ADD
them?”
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Yes;
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
point
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
wish
ADD
to
ADD
ascertain.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
merely
ADD
a
ADD
matter
ADD
of
ADD
time.
ADD
Hullo!
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
hear
ADD
some
ADD
news
ADD
now
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
vengeance!
ADD
Here
ADD
is
ADD
Gregson
ADD
coming
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
with
ADD
beatitude
ADD
written
ADD
upon
ADD
every
ADD
feature
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
face.
ADD
Bound
ADD
for
ADD
us,
ADD
I
ADD
know.
ADD
Yes,
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
stopping.
ADD
There
ADD
he
ADD
is!”
ADD

ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
violent
ADD
peal
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
bell,
ADD
and
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
seconds
ADD
the
ADD
fair-haired
ADD
detective
ADD
came
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
stairs,
ADD
three
ADD
steps
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
time,
ADD
and
ADD
burst
ADD
into
ADD
our
ADD
sitting-room.
ADD

ADD
“My
ADD
dear
ADD
fellow,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
wringing
ADD
Holmes’
ADD
unresponsive
ADD
hand,
ADD
“congratulate
ADD
me!
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
made
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
thing
ADD
as
ADD
clear
ADD
as
ADD
day.”
ADD

ADD
A
ADD
shade
ADD
of
ADD
anxiety
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
cross
ADD
my
ADD
companion’s
ADD
expressive
ADD
face.
ADD

ADD
“Do
ADD
you
ADD
mean
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
right
ADD
track?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
right
ADD
track!
ADD
Why,
ADD
sir,
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
under
ADD
lock
ADD
and
ADD
key.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
his
ADD
name
ADD
is?”
ADD

ADD
“Arthur
ADD
Charpentier,
ADD
sub-lieutenant
ADD
in
ADD
Her
ADD
Majesty’s
ADD
navy,”
ADD
cried
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
pompously,
ADD
rubbing
ADD
his
ADD
fat
ADD
hands
ADD
and
ADD
inflating
ADD
his
ADD
chest.
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
gave
ADD
a
ADD
sigh
ADD
of
ADD
relief,
ADD
and
ADD
relaxed
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
smile.
ADD

ADD
“Take
ADD
a
ADD
seat,
ADD
and
ADD
try
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
cigars,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“We
ADD
are
ADD
anxious
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
how
ADD
you
ADD
managed
ADD
it.
ADD
Will
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
some
ADD
whiskey
ADD
and
ADD
water?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
don’t
ADD
mind
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
do,”
ADD
the
ADD
detective
ADD
answered.
ADD
“The
ADD
tremendous
ADD
exertions
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
gone
ADD
through
ADD
during
ADD
the
ADD
last
ADD
day
ADD
or
ADD
two
ADD
have
ADD
worn
ADD
me
ADD
out.
ADD
Not
ADD
so
ADD
much
ADD
bodily
ADD
exertion,
ADD
you
ADD
understand,
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
strain
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
mind.
ADD
You
ADD
will
ADD
appreciate
ADD
that,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
for
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
both
ADD
brain-workers.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
do
ADD
me
ADD
too
ADD
much
ADD
honour,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
gravely.
ADD
“Let
ADD
us
ADD
hear
ADD
how
ADD
you
ADD
arrived
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
most
ADD
gratifying
ADD
result.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
detective
ADD
seated
ADD
himself
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
arm-chair,
ADD
and
ADD
puffed
ADD
complacently
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
cigar.
ADD
Then
ADD
suddenly
ADD
he
ADD
slapped
ADD
his
ADD
thigh
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
paroxysm
ADD
of
ADD
amusement.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
fun
ADD
of
ADD
it
ADD
is,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
“that
ADD
that
ADD
fool
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
who
ADD
thinks
ADD
himself
ADD
so
ADD
smart,
ADD
has
ADD
gone
ADD
off
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wrong
ADD
track
ADD
altogether.
ADD
He
ADD
is
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
secretary
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
more
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
crime
ADD
than
ADD
the
ADD
babe
ADD
unborn.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
doubt
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
caught
ADD
him
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
time.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
idea
ADD
tickled
ADD
Gregson
ADD
so
ADD
much
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
laughed
ADD
until
ADD
he
ADD
choked.
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
how
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
get
ADD
your
ADD
clue?”
ADD

ADD
“Ah,
ADD
I’ll
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
all
ADD
about
ADD
it.
ADD
Of
ADD
course,
ADD
Doctor
ADD
Watson,
ADD
this
ADD
is
ADD
strictly
ADD
between
ADD
ourselves.
ADD
The
ADD
first
ADD
difficulty
ADD
which
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
contend
ADD
with
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
finding
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
American’s
ADD
antecedents.
ADD
Some
ADD
people
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
waited
ADD
until
ADD
their
ADD
advertisements
ADD
were
ADD
answered,
ADD
or
ADD
until
ADD
parties
ADD
came
ADD
forward
ADD
and
ADD
volunteered
ADD
information.
ADD
That
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
Tobias
ADD
Gregson’s
ADD
way
ADD
of
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
work.
ADD
You
ADD
remember
ADD
the
ADD
hat
ADD
beside
ADD
the
ADD
dead
ADD
man?”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes;
ADD
“by
ADD
John
ADD
Underwood
ADD
and
ADD
Sons,
ADD
129,
ADD
Camberwell
ADD
Road.”
ADD

ADD
Gregson
ADD
looked
ADD
quite
ADD
crest-fallen.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
idea
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
noticed
ADD
that,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“Have
ADD
you
ADD
been
ADD
there?”
ADD

ADD
“No.”
ADD

ADD
“Ha!”
ADD
cried
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
relieved
ADD
voice;
ADD
“you
ADD
should
ADD
never
ADD
neglect
ADD
a
ADD
chance,
ADD
however
ADD
small
ADD
it
ADD
may
ADD
seem.”
ADD

ADD
“To
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
mind,
ADD
nothing
ADD
is
ADD
little,”
ADD
remarked
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
sententiously.
ADD

ADD
“Well,
ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
to
ADD
Underwood,
ADD
and
ADD
asked
ADD
him
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
sold
ADD
a
ADD
hat
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
size
ADD
and
ADD
description.
ADD
He
ADD
looked
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
books,
ADD
and
ADD
came
ADD
on
ADD
it
ADD
at
ADD
once.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
sent
ADD
the
ADD
hat
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
residing
ADD
at
ADD
Charpentier’s
ADD
Boarding
ADD
Establishment,
ADD
Torquay
ADD
Terrace.
ADD
Thus
ADD
I
ADD
got
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
address.”
ADD

ADD
“Smart—very
ADD
smart!”
ADD
murmured
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
next
ADD
called
ADD
upon
ADD
Madame
ADD
Charpentier,”
ADD
continued
ADD
the
ADD
detective.
ADD
“I
ADD
found
ADD
her
ADD
very
ADD
pale
ADD
and
ADD
distressed.
ADD
Her
ADD
daughter
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
too—an
ADD
uncommonly
ADD
fine
ADD
girl
ADD
she
ADD
is,
ADD
too;
ADD
she
ADD
was
ADD
looking
ADD
red
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
eyes
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
lips
ADD
trembled
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
spoke
ADD
to
ADD
her.
ADD
That
ADD
didn’t
ADD
escape
ADD
my
ADD
notice.
ADD
I
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
smell
ADD
a
ADD
rat.
ADD
You
ADD
know
ADD
the
ADD
feeling,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
when
ADD
you
ADD
come
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
right
ADD
scent—a
ADD
kind
ADD
of
ADD
thrill
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
nerves.
ADD
‘Have
ADD
you
ADD
heard
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mysterious
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
your
ADD
late
ADD
boarder
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Enoch
ADD
J.
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
of
ADD
Cleveland?’
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
mother
ADD
nodded.
ADD
She
ADD
didn’t
ADD
seem
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
out
ADD
a
ADD
word.
ADD
The
ADD
daughter
ADD
burst
ADD
into
ADD
tears.
ADD
I
ADD
felt
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
ever
ADD
that
ADD
these
ADD
people
ADD
knew
ADD
something
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
matter.
ADD

ADD
“‘At
ADD
what
ADD
o’clock
ADD
did
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Drebber
ADD
leave
ADD
your
ADD
house
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
train?’
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“‘At
ADD
eight
ADD
o’clock,’
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
gulping
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
throat
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
down
ADD
her
ADD
agitation.
ADD
‘His
ADD
secretary,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
said
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
two
ADD
trains—one
ADD
at
ADD
9.15
ADD
and
ADD
one
ADD
at
ADD
11.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
catch
ADD
the
ADD
first.
ADD
14
ADD

ADD
“‘And
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
last
ADD
which
ADD
you
ADD
saw
ADD
of
ADD
him?’
ADD

ADD
“A
ADD
terrible
ADD
change
ADD
came
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
woman’s
ADD
face
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
the
ADD
question.
ADD
Her
ADD
features
ADD
turned
ADD
perfectly
ADD
livid.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
some
ADD
seconds
ADD
before
ADD
she
ADD
could
ADD
get
ADD
out
ADD
the
ADD
single
ADD
word
ADD
‘Yes’—and
ADD
when
ADD
it
ADD
did
ADD
come
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
husky
ADD
unnatural
ADD
tone.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
was
ADD
silence
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
moment,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
the
ADD
daughter
ADD
spoke
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
calm
ADD
clear
ADD
voice.
ADD

ADD
“‘No
ADD
good
ADD
can
ADD
ever
ADD
come
ADD
of
ADD
falsehood,
ADD
mother,’
ADD
she
ADD
said.
ADD
‘Let
ADD
us
ADD
be
ADD
frank
ADD
with
ADD
this
ADD
gentleman.
ADD
We
ADD
did
ADD
see
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Drebber
ADD
again.’
ADD

ADD
“‘God
ADD
forgive
ADD
you!’
ADD
cried
ADD
Madame
ADD
Charpentier,
ADD
throwing
ADD
up
ADD
her
ADD
hands
ADD
and
ADD
sinking
ADD
back
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
chair.
ADD
‘You
ADD
have
ADD
murdered
ADD
your
ADD
brother.’
ADD

ADD
“‘Arthur
ADD
would
ADD
rather
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
spoke
ADD
the
ADD
truth,’
ADD
the
ADD
girl
ADD
answered
ADD
firmly.
ADD

ADD
“‘You
ADD
had
ADD
best
ADD
tell
ADD
me
ADD
all
ADD
about
ADD
it
ADD
now,’
ADD
I
ADD
said.
ADD
‘Half-confidences
ADD
are
ADD
worse
ADD
than
ADD
none.
ADD
Besides,
ADD
you
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
know
ADD
how
ADD
much
ADD
we
ADD
know
ADD
of
ADD
it.’
ADD

ADD
“‘On
ADD
your
ADD
head
ADD
be
ADD
it,
ADD
Alice!’
ADD
cried
ADD
her
ADD
mother;
ADD
and
ADD
then,
ADD
turning
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
‘I
ADD
will
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
all,
ADD
sir.
ADD
Do
ADD
not
ADD
imagine
ADD
that
ADD
my
ADD
agitation
ADD
on
ADD
behalf
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
son
ADD
arises
ADD
from
ADD
any
ADD
fear
ADD
lest
ADD
he
ADD
should
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
hand
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
terrible
ADD
affair.
ADD
He
ADD
is
ADD
utterly
ADD
innocent
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
My
ADD
dread
ADD
is,
ADD
however,
ADD
that
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
eyes
ADD
and
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
eyes
ADD
of
ADD
others
ADD
he
ADD
may
ADD
appear
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
compromised.
ADD
That
ADD
however
ADD
is
ADD
surely
ADD
impossible.
ADD
His
ADD
high
ADD
character,
ADD
his
ADD
profession,
ADD
his
ADD
antecedents
ADD
would
ADD
all
ADD
forbid
ADD
it.’
ADD

ADD
“‘Your
ADD
best
ADD
way
ADD
is
ADD
to
ADD
make
ADD
a
ADD
clean
ADD
breast
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
facts,’
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD
‘Depend
ADD
upon
ADD
it,
ADD
if
ADD
your
ADD
son
ADD
is
ADD
innocent
ADD
he
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
none
ADD
the
ADD
worse.’
ADD

ADD
“‘Perhaps,
ADD
Alice,
ADD
you
ADD
had
ADD
better
ADD
leave
ADD
us
ADD
together,’
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
daughter
ADD
withdrew.
ADD
‘Now,
ADD
sir,’
ADD
she
ADD
continued,
ADD
‘I
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
intention
ADD
of
ADD
telling
ADD
you
ADD
all
ADD
this,
ADD
but
ADD
since
ADD
my
ADD
poor
ADD
daughter
ADD
has
ADD
disclosed
ADD
it
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
alternative.
ADD
Having
ADD
once
ADD
decided
ADD
to
ADD
speak,
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
all
ADD
without
ADD
omitting
ADD
any
ADD
particular.’
ADD

ADD
“‘It
ADD
is
ADD
your
ADD
wisest
ADD
course,’
ADD
said
ADD
I.
ADD

ADD
“‘Mr.
ADD
Drebber
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
with
ADD
us
ADD
nearly
ADD
three
ADD
weeks.
ADD
He
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
secretary,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
travelling
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
Continent.
ADD
I
ADD
noticed
ADD
a
ADD
“Copenhagen”
ADD
label
ADD
upon
ADD
each
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
trunks,
ADD
showing
ADD
that
ADD
that
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
their
ADD
last
ADD
stopping
ADD
place.
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
quiet
ADD
reserved
ADD
man,
ADD
but
ADD
his
ADD
employer,
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
sorry
ADD
to
ADD
say,
ADD
was
ADD
far
ADD
otherwise.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
coarse
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
habits
ADD
and
ADD
brutish
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
ways.
ADD
The
ADD
very
ADD
night
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
arrival
ADD
he
ADD
became
ADD
very
ADD
much
ADD
the
ADD
worse
ADD
for
ADD
drink,
ADD
and,
ADD
indeed,
ADD
after
ADD
twelve
ADD
o’clock
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
day
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
hardly
ADD
ever
ADD
be
ADD
said
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
sober.
ADD
His
ADD
manners
ADD
towards
ADD
the
ADD
maid-servants
ADD
were
ADD
disgustingly
ADD
free
ADD
and
ADD
familiar.
ADD
Worst
ADD
of
ADD
all,
ADD
he
ADD
speedily
ADD
assumed
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
attitude
ADD
towards
ADD
my
ADD
daughter,
ADD
Alice,
ADD
and
ADD
spoke
ADD
to
ADD
her
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
once
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
way
ADD
which,
ADD
fortunately,
ADD
she
ADD
is
ADD
too
ADD
innocent
ADD
to
ADD
understand.
ADD
On
ADD
one
ADD
occasion
ADD
he
ADD
actually
ADD
seized
ADD
her
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
arms
ADD
and
ADD
embraced
ADD
her—an
ADD
outrage
ADD
which
ADD
caused
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
secretary
ADD
to
ADD
reproach
ADD
him
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
unmanly
ADD
conduct.’
ADD

ADD
“‘But
ADD
why
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
stand
ADD
all
ADD
this,’
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD
‘I
ADD
suppose
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
can
ADD
get
ADD
rid
ADD
of
ADD
your
ADD
boarders
ADD
when
ADD
you
ADD
wish.’
ADD

ADD
“Mrs.
ADD
Charpentier
ADD
blushed
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
pertinent
ADD
question.
ADD
‘Would
ADD
to
ADD
God
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
given
ADD
him
ADD
notice
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
day
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
came,’
ADD
she
ADD
said.
ADD
‘But
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
sore
ADD
temptation.
ADD
They
ADD
were
ADD
paying
ADD
a
ADD
pound
ADD
a
ADD
day
ADD
each—fourteen
ADD
pounds
ADD
a
ADD
week,
ADD
and
ADD
this
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
slack
ADD
season.
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
a
ADD
widow,
ADD
and
ADD
my
ADD
boy
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Navy
ADD
has
ADD
cost
ADD
me
ADD
much.
ADD
I
ADD
grudged
ADD
to
ADD
lose
ADD
the
ADD
money.
ADD
I
ADD
acted
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
best.
ADD
This
ADD
last
ADD
was
ADD
too
ADD
much,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
gave
ADD
him
ADD
notice
ADD
to
ADD
leave
ADD
on
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
That
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
reason
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
going.’
ADD

ADD
“‘Well?’
ADD

ADD
“‘My
ADD
heart
ADD
grew
ADD
light
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
him
ADD
drive
ADD
away.
ADD
My
ADD
son
ADD
is
ADD
on
ADD
leave
ADD
just
ADD
now,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
tell
ADD
him
ADD
anything
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
this,
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
temper
ADD
is
ADD
violent,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
passionately
ADD
fond
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
sister.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
closed
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
behind
ADD
them
ADD
a
ADD
load
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
lifted
ADD
from
ADD
my
ADD
mind.
ADD
Alas,
ADD
in
ADD
less
ADD
than
ADD
an
ADD
hour
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
ring
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
bell,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
learned
ADD
that
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Drebber
ADD
had
ADD
returned.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
much
ADD
excited,
ADD
and
ADD
evidently
ADD
the
ADD
worse
ADD
for
ADD
drink.
ADD
He
ADD
forced
ADD
his
ADD
way
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
where
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
sitting
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
daughter,
ADD
and
ADD
made
ADD
some
ADD
incoherent
ADD
remark
ADD
about
ADD
having
ADD
missed
ADD
his
ADD
train.
ADD
He
ADD
then
ADD
turned
ADD
to
ADD
Alice,
ADD
and
ADD
before
ADD
my
ADD
very
ADD
face,
ADD
proposed
ADD
to
ADD
her
ADD
that
ADD
she
ADD
should
ADD
fly
ADD
with
ADD
him.
ADD
“You
ADD
are
ADD
of
ADD
age,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“and
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
law
ADD
to
ADD
stop
ADD
you.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
money
ADD
enough
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
spare.
ADD
Never
ADD
mind
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
girl
ADD
here,
ADD
but
ADD
come
ADD
along
ADD
with
ADD
me
ADD
now
ADD
straight
ADD
away.
ADD
You
ADD
shall
ADD
live
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
princess.”
ADD
Poor
ADD
Alice
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
frightened
ADD
that
ADD
she
ADD
shrunk
ADD
away
ADD
from
ADD
him,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
caught
ADD
her
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
wrist
ADD
and
ADD
endeavoured
ADD
to
ADD
draw
ADD
her
ADD
towards
ADD
the
ADD
door.
ADD
I
ADD
screamed,
ADD
and
ADD
at
ADD
that
ADD
moment
ADD
my
ADD
son
ADD
Arthur
ADD
came
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room.
ADD
What
ADD
happened
ADD
then
ADD
I
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
know.
ADD
I
ADD
heard
ADD
oaths
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
confused
ADD
sounds
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
scuffle.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
too
ADD
terrified
ADD
to
ADD
raise
ADD
my
ADD
head.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
did
ADD
look
ADD
up
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
Arthur
ADD
standing
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
doorway
ADD
laughing,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
stick
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
hand.
ADD
“I
ADD
don’t
ADD
think
ADD
that
ADD
fine
ADD
fellow
ADD
will
ADD
trouble
ADD
us
ADD
again,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“I
ADD
will
ADD
just
ADD
go
ADD
after
ADD
him
ADD
and
ADD
see
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
does
ADD
with
ADD
himself.”
ADD
With
ADD
those
ADD
words
ADD
he
ADD
took
ADD
his
ADD
hat
ADD
and
ADD
started
ADD
off
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
street.
ADD
The
ADD
next
ADD
morning
ADD
we
ADD
heard
ADD
of
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
mysterious
ADD
death.’
ADD

ADD
“This
ADD
statement
ADD
came
ADD
from
ADD
Mrs.
ADD
Charpentier’s
ADD
lips
ADD
with
ADD
many
ADD
gasps
ADD
and
ADD
pauses.
ADD
At
ADD
times
ADD
she
ADD
spoke
ADD
so
ADD
low
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
hardly
ADD
catch
ADD
the
ADD
words.
ADD
I
ADD
made
ADD
shorthand
ADD
notes
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
however,
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
no
ADD
possibility
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
mistake.”
ADD

ADD
“It’s
ADD
quite
ADD
exciting,”
ADD
said
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
yawn.
ADD
“What
ADD
happened
ADD
next?”
ADD

ADD
“When
ADD
Mrs.
ADD
Charpentier
ADD
paused,”
ADD
the
ADD
detective
ADD
continued,
ADD
“I
ADD
saw
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
case
ADD
hung
ADD
upon
ADD
one
ADD
point.
ADD
Fixing
ADD
her
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
eye
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
way
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
always
ADD
found
ADD
effective
ADD
with
ADD
women,
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
her
ADD
at
ADD
what
ADD
hour
ADD
her
ADD
son
ADD
returned.
ADD

ADD
“‘I
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
know,’
ADD
she
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“‘Not
ADD
know?’
ADD

ADD
“‘No;
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
a
ADD
latch-key,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
let
ADD
himself
ADD
in.’
ADD

ADD
“‘After
ADD
you
ADD
went
ADD
to
ADD
bed?’
ADD

ADD
“‘Yes.’
ADD

ADD
“‘When
ADD
did
ADD
you
ADD
go
ADD
to
ADD
bed?’
ADD

ADD
“‘About
ADD
eleven.’
ADD

ADD
“‘So
ADD
your
ADD
son
ADD
was
ADD
gone
ADD
at
ADD
least
ADD
two
ADD
hours?’
ADD

ADD
“‘Yes.’
ADD

ADD
“‘Possibly
ADD
four
ADD
or
ADD
five?’
ADD

ADD
“‘Yes.’
ADD

ADD
“‘What
ADD
was
ADD
he
ADD
doing
ADD
during
ADD
that
ADD
time?’
ADD

ADD
“‘I
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
know,’
ADD
she
ADD
answered,
ADD
turning
ADD
white
ADD
to
ADD
her
ADD
very
ADD
lips.
ADD

ADD
“Of
ADD
course
ADD
after
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
nothing
ADD
more
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
done.
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
out
ADD
where
ADD
Lieutenant
ADD
Charpentier
ADD
was,
ADD
took
ADD
two
ADD
officers
ADD
with
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
arrested
ADD
him.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
touched
ADD
him
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
shoulder
ADD
and
ADD
warned
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
come
ADD
quietly
ADD
with
ADD
us,
ADD
he
ADD
answered
ADD
us
ADD
as
ADD
bold
ADD
as
ADD
brass,
ADD
‘I
ADD
suppose
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
arresting
ADD
me
ADD
for
ADD
being
ADD
concerned
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
scoundrel
ADD
Drebber,’
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
We
ADD
had
ADD
said
ADD
nothing
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
about
ADD
it,
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
alluding
ADD
to
ADD
it
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
most
ADD
suspicious
ADD
aspect.”
ADD

ADD
“Very,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes.
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
still
ADD
carried
ADD
the
ADD
heavy
ADD
stick
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
mother
ADD
described
ADD
him
ADD
as
ADD
having
ADD
with
ADD
him
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
followed
ADD
Drebber.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
stout
ADD
oak
ADD
cudgel.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
is
ADD
your
ADD
theory,
ADD
then?”
ADD

ADD
“Well,
ADD
my
ADD
theory
ADD
is
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
followed
ADD
Drebber
ADD
as
ADD
far
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road.
ADD
When
ADD
there,
ADD
a
ADD
fresh
ADD
altercation
ADD
arose
ADD
between
ADD
them,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
course
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
Drebber
ADD
received
ADD
a
ADD
blow
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
stick,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
pit
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
stomach,
ADD
perhaps,
ADD
which
ADD
killed
ADD
him
ADD
without
ADD
leaving
ADD
any
ADD
mark.
ADD
The
ADD
night
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
wet
ADD
that
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
was
ADD
about,
ADD
so
ADD
Charpentier
ADD
dragged
ADD
the
ADD
body
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
victim
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
empty
ADD
house.
ADD
As
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
candle,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
blood,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
writing
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
wall,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
ring,
ADD
they
ADD
may
ADD
all
ADD
be
ADD
so
ADD
many
ADD
tricks
ADD
to
ADD
throw
ADD
the
ADD
police
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
wrong
ADD
scent.”
ADD

ADD
“Well
ADD
done!”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
encouraging
ADD
voice.
ADD
“Really,
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
getting
ADD
along.
ADD
We
ADD
shall
ADD
make
ADD
something
ADD
of
ADD
you
ADD
yet.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
flatter
ADD
myself
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
managed
ADD
it
ADD
rather
ADD
neatly,”
ADD
the
ADD
detective
ADD
answered
ADD
proudly.
ADD
“The
ADD
young
ADD
man
ADD
volunteered
ADD
a
ADD
statement,
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
said
ADD
that
ADD
after
ADD
following
ADD
Drebber
ADD
some
ADD
time,
ADD
the
ADD
latter
ADD
perceived
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
cab
ADD
in
ADD
order
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
away
ADD
from
ADD
him.
ADD
On
ADD
his
ADD
way
ADD
home
ADD
he
ADD
met
ADD
an
ADD
old
ADD
shipmate,
ADD
and
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
walk
ADD
with
ADD
him.
ADD
On
ADD
being
ADD
asked
ADD
where
ADD
this
ADD
old
ADD
shipmate
ADD
lived,
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
unable
ADD
to
ADD
give
ADD
any
ADD
satisfactory
ADD
reply.
ADD
I
ADD
think
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
case
ADD
fits
ADD
together
ADD
uncommonly
ADD
well.
ADD
What
ADD
amuses
ADD
me
ADD
is
ADD
to
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
started
ADD
off
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wrong
ADD
scent.
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
afraid
ADD
he
ADD
won’t
ADD
make
ADD
much
ADD
of
ADD
15
ADD
Why,
ADD
by
ADD
Jove,
ADD
here’s
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
man
ADD
himself!”
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
indeed
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
ascended
ADD
the
ADD
stairs
ADD
while
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
talking,
ADD
and
ADD
who
ADD
now
ADD
entered
ADD
the
ADD
room.
ADD
The
ADD
assurance
ADD
and
ADD
jauntiness
ADD
which
ADD
generally
ADD
marked
ADD
his
ADD
demeanour
ADD
and
ADD
dress
ADD
were,
ADD
however,
ADD
wanting.
ADD
His
ADD
face
ADD
was
ADD
disturbed
ADD
and
ADD
troubled,
ADD
while
ADD
his
ADD
clothes
ADD
were
ADD
disarranged
ADD
and
ADD
untidy.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
evidently
ADD
come
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
intention
ADD
of
ADD
consulting
ADD
with
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
for
ADD
on
ADD
perceiving
ADD
his
ADD
colleague
ADD
he
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
embarrassed
ADD
and
ADD
put
ADD
out.
ADD
He
ADD
stood
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
centre
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
fumbling
ADD
nervously
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
hat
ADD
and
ADD
uncertain
ADD
what
ADD
to
ADD
do.
ADD
“This
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
most
ADD
extraordinary
ADD
case,”
ADD
he
ADD
said
ADD
at
ADD
last—“a
ADD
most
ADD
incomprehensible
ADD
affair.”
ADD

ADD
“Ah,
ADD
you
ADD
find
ADD
it
ADD
so,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Lestrade!”
ADD
cried
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
triumphantly.
ADD
“I
ADD
thought
ADD
you
ADD
would
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
that
ADD
conclusion.
ADD
Have
ADD
you
ADD
managed
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
the
ADD
Secretary,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson?”
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
Secretary,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson,”
ADD
said
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
gravely,
ADD
“was
ADD
murdered
ADD
at
ADD
Halliday’s
ADD
Private
ADD
Hotel
ADD
about
ADD
six
ADD
o’clock
ADD
this
ADD
morning.”

ADD

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
VII.
ADD
LIGHT
ADD
IN
ADD
THE
ADD
DARKNESS.
ADD

ADD
THE
ADD
intelligence
ADD
with
ADD
which
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
greeted
ADD
us
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
momentous
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
unexpected,
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
all
ADD
three
ADD
fairly
ADD
dumfoundered.
ADD
Gregson
ADD
sprang
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
chair
ADD
and
ADD
upset
ADD
the
ADD
remainder
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
whiskey
ADD
and
ADD
water.
ADD
I
ADD
stared
ADD
in
ADD
silence
ADD
at
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
whose
ADD
lips
ADD
were
ADD
compressed
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
brows
ADD
drawn
ADD
down
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
eyes.
ADD

ADD
“Stangerson
ADD
too!”
ADD
he
ADD
muttered.
ADD
“The
ADD
plot
ADD
thickens.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
was
ADD
quite
ADD
thick
ADD
enough
ADD
before,”
ADD
grumbled
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
taking
ADD
a
ADD
chair.
ADD
“I
ADD
seem
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
dropped
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
sort
ADD
of
ADD
council
ADD
of
ADD
war.”
ADD

ADD
“Are
ADD
you—are
ADD
you
ADD
sure
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
piece
ADD
of
ADD
intelligence?”
ADD
stammered
ADD
Gregson.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
just
ADD
come
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
room,”
ADD
said
ADD
Lestrade.
ADD
“I
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
to
ADD
discover
ADD
what
ADD
had
ADD
occurred.”
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
hearing
ADD
Gregson’s
ADD
view
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
matter,”
ADD
Holmes
ADD
observed.
ADD
“Would
ADD
you
ADD
mind
ADD
letting
ADD
us
ADD
know
ADD
what
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
seen
ADD
and
ADD
done?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
objection,”
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
answered,
ADD
seating
ADD
himself.
ADD
“I
ADD
freely
ADD
confess
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
opinion
ADD
that
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
was
ADD
concerned
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
Drebber.
ADD
This
ADD
fresh
ADD
development
ADD
has
ADD
shown
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
completely
ADD
mistaken.
ADD
Full
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
one
ADD
idea,
ADD
I
ADD
set
ADD
myself
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
out
ADD
what
ADD
had
ADD
become
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Secretary.
ADD
They
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
seen
ADD
together
ADD
at
ADD
Euston
ADD
Station
ADD
about
ADD
half-past
ADD
eight
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
evening
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
third.
ADD
At
ADD
two
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
morning
ADD
Drebber
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
found
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road.
ADD
The
ADD
question
ADD
which
ADD
confronted
ADD
me
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
out
ADD
how
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
employed
ADD
between
ADD
8.30
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
crime,
ADD
and
ADD
what
ADD
had
ADD
become
ADD
of
ADD
him
ADD
afterwards.
ADD
I
ADD
telegraphed
ADD
to
ADD
Liverpool,
ADD
giving
ADD
a
ADD
description
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
man,
ADD
and
ADD
warning
ADD
them
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
a
ADD
watch
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
American
ADD
boats.
ADD
I
ADD
then
ADD
set
ADD
to
ADD
work
ADD
calling
ADD
upon
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
hotels
ADD
and
ADD
lodging-houses
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
vicinity
ADD
of
ADD
Euston.
ADD
You
ADD
see,
ADD
I
ADD
argued
ADD
that
ADD
if
ADD
Drebber
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
companion
ADD
had
ADD
become
ADD
separated,
ADD
the
ADD
natural
ADD
course
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
latter
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
up
ADD
somewhere
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
vicinity
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
night,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
to
ADD
hang
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
station
ADD
again
ADD
next
ADD
morning.”
ADD

ADD
“They
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
likely
ADD
to
ADD
agree
ADD
on
ADD
some
ADD
meeting-place
ADD
beforehand,”
ADD
remarked
ADD
Holmes.
ADD

ADD
“So
ADD
it
ADD
proved.
ADD
I
ADD
spent
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
of
ADD
yesterday
ADD
evening
ADD
in
ADD
making
ADD
enquiries
ADD
entirely
ADD
without
ADD
avail.
ADD
This
ADD
morning
ADD
I
ADD
began
ADD
very
ADD
early,
ADD
and
ADD
at
ADD
eight
ADD
o’clock
ADD
I
ADD
reached
ADD
Halliday’s
ADD
Private
ADD
Hotel,
ADD
in
ADD
Little
ADD
George
ADD
Street.
ADD
On
ADD
my
ADD
enquiry
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
whether
ADD
a
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
was
ADD
living
ADD
there,
ADD
they
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
answered
ADD
me
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
affirmative.
ADD

ADD
“‘No
ADD
doubt
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
gentleman
ADD
whom
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
expecting,’
ADD
they
ADD
said.
ADD
‘He
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
waiting
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
gentleman
ADD
for
ADD
two
ADD
days.’
ADD

ADD
“‘Where
ADD
is
ADD
he
ADD
now?’
ADD
I
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“‘He
ADD
is
ADD
upstairs
ADD
in
ADD
bed.
ADD
He
ADD
wished
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
called
ADD
at
ADD
nine.’
ADD

ADD
“‘I
ADD
will
ADD
go
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
see
ADD
him
ADD
at
ADD
once,’
ADD
I
ADD
said.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
my
ADD
sudden
ADD
appearance
ADD
might
ADD
shake
ADD
his
ADD
nerves
ADD
and
ADD
lead
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
say
ADD
something
ADD
unguarded.
ADD
The
ADD
Boots
ADD
volunteered
ADD
to
ADD
show
ADD
me
ADD
the
ADD
room:
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
second
ADD
floor,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
corridor
ADD
leading
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
it.
ADD
The
ADD
Boots
ADD
pointed
ADD
out
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
about
ADD
to
ADD
go
ADD
downstairs
ADD
again
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
something
ADD
that
ADD
made
ADD
me
ADD
feel
ADD
sickish,
ADD
in
ADD
spite
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
twenty
ADD
years’
ADD
experience.
ADD
From
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
there
ADD
curled
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
red
ADD
ribbon
ADD
of
ADD
blood,
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
meandered
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
passage
ADD
and
ADD
formed
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
pool
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
skirting
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
side.
ADD
I
ADD
gave
ADD
a
ADD
cry,
ADD
which
ADD
brought
ADD
the
ADD
Boots
ADD
back.
ADD
He
ADD
nearly
ADD
fainted
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
saw
ADD
it.
ADD
The
ADD
door
ADD
was
ADD
locked
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
inside,
ADD
but
ADD
we
ADD
put
ADD
our
ADD
shoulders
ADD
to
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
knocked
ADD
it
ADD
in.
ADD
The
ADD
window
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
was
ADD
open,
ADD
and
ADD
beside
ADD
the
ADD
window,
ADD
all
ADD
huddled
ADD
up,
ADD
lay
ADD
the
ADD
body
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
nightdress.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
quite
ADD
dead,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
time,
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
limbs
ADD
were
ADD
rigid
ADD
and
ADD
cold.
ADD
When
ADD
we
ADD
turned
ADD
him
ADD
over,
ADD
the
ADD
Boots
ADD
recognized
ADD
him
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
as
ADD
being
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
gentleman
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
engaged
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson.
ADD
The
ADD
cause
ADD
of
ADD
death
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
deep
ADD
stab
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
left
ADD
side,
ADD
which
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
penetrated
ADD
the
ADD
heart.
ADD
And
ADD
now
ADD
comes
ADD
the
ADD
strangest
ADD
part
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
affair.
ADD
What
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
suppose
ADD
was
ADD
above
ADD
the
ADD
murdered
ADD
man?”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
felt
ADD
a
ADD
creeping
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
flesh,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
presentiment
ADD
of
ADD
coming
ADD
horror,
ADD
even
ADD
before
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
word
ADD
RACHE,
ADD
written
ADD
in
ADD
letters
ADD
of
ADD
blood,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
was
ADD
it,”
ADD
said
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
awe-struck
ADD
voice;
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
were
ADD
all
ADD
silent
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
while.
ADD

ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
something
ADD
so
ADD
methodical
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
incomprehensible
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
deeds
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
unknown
ADD
assassin,
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
imparted
ADD
a
ADD
fresh
ADD
ghastliness
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
crimes.
ADD
My
ADD
nerves,
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
steady
ADD
enough
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
field
ADD
of
ADD
battle
ADD
tingled
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
seen,”
ADD
continued
ADD
Lestrade.
ADD
“A
ADD
milk
ADD
boy,
ADD
passing
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
way
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
dairy,
ADD
happened
ADD
to
ADD
walk
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
lane
ADD
which
ADD
leads
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
mews
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
back
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
hotel.
ADD
He
ADD
noticed
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
ladder,
ADD
which
ADD
usually
ADD
lay
ADD
there,
ADD
was
ADD
raised
ADD
against
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
windows
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
second
ADD
floor,
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
wide
ADD
open.
ADD
After
ADD
passing,
ADD
he
ADD
looked
ADD
back
ADD
and
ADD
saw
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
descend
ADD
the
ADD
ladder.
ADD
He
ADD
came
ADD
down
ADD
so
ADD
quietly
ADD
and
ADD
openly
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
boy
ADD
imagined
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
some
ADD
carpenter
ADD
or
ADD
joiner
ADD
at
ADD
work
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
hotel.
ADD
He
ADD
took
ADD
no
ADD
particular
ADD
notice
ADD
of
ADD
him,
ADD
beyond
ADD
thinking
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
mind
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
early
ADD
for
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
at
ADD
work.
ADD
He
ADD
has
ADD
an
ADD
impression
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
tall,
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
reddish
ADD
face,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
dressed
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
long,
ADD
brownish
ADD
coat.
ADD
He
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
stayed
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
some
ADD
little
ADD
time
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
murder,
ADD
for
ADD
we
ADD
found
ADD
blood-stained
ADD
water
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
basin,
ADD
where
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
washed
ADD
his
ADD
hands,
ADD
and
ADD
marks
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
sheets
ADD
where
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
deliberately
ADD
wiped
ADD
his
ADD
knife.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
glanced
ADD
at
ADD
Holmes
ADD
on
ADD
hearing
ADD
the
ADD
description
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
murderer,
ADD
which
ADD
tallied
ADD
so
ADD
exactly
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
own.
ADD
There
ADD
was,
ADD
however,
ADD
no
ADD
trace
ADD
of
ADD
exultation
ADD
or
ADD
satisfaction
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
face.
ADD

ADD
“Did
ADD
you
ADD
find
ADD
nothing
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
which
ADD
could
ADD
furnish
ADD
a
ADD
clue
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
murderer?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Nothing.
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
had
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
purse
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
pocket,
ADD
but
ADD
it
ADD
seems
ADD
that
ADD
this
ADD
was
ADD
usual,
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
did
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
paying.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
eighty
ADD
odd
ADD
pounds
ADD
in
ADD
it,
ADD
but
ADD
nothing
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
taken.
ADD
Whatever
ADD
the
ADD
motives
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
extraordinary
ADD
crimes,
ADD
robbery
ADD
is
ADD
certainly
ADD
not
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
them.
ADD
There
ADD
were
ADD
no
ADD
papers
ADD
or
ADD
memoranda
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
murdered
ADD
man’s
ADD
pocket,
ADD
except
ADD
a
ADD
single
ADD
telegram,
ADD
dated
ADD
from
ADD
Cleveland
ADD
about
ADD
a
ADD
month
ADD
ago,
ADD
and
ADD
containing
ADD
the
ADD
words,
ADD
‘J.
ADD
H.
ADD
is
ADD
in
ADD
Europe.’
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
name
ADD
appended
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
message.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
nothing
ADD
else?”
ADD
Holmes
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“Nothing
ADD
of
ADD
any
ADD
importance.
ADD
The
ADD
man’s
ADD
novel,
ADD
with
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
read
ADD
himself
ADD
to
ADD
sleep
ADD
was
ADD
lying
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
bed,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
pipe
ADD
was
ADD
on
ADD
a
ADD
chair
ADD
beside
ADD
him.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
glass
ADD
of
ADD
water
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
table,
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
window-sill
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
chip
ADD
ointment
ADD
box
ADD
containing
ADD
a
ADD
couple
ADD
of
ADD
pills.”
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
sprang
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
chair
ADD
with
ADD
an
ADD
exclamation
ADD
of
ADD
delight.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
last
ADD
link,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
exultantly.
ADD
“My
ADD
case
ADD
is
ADD
complete.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
two
ADD
detectives
ADD
stared
ADD
at
ADD
him
ADD
in
ADD
amazement.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
now
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
hands,”
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
said,
ADD
confidently,
ADD
“all
ADD
the
ADD
threads
ADD
which
ADD
have
ADD
formed
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
tangle.
ADD
There
ADD
are,
ADD
of
ADD
course,
ADD
details
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
filled
ADD
in,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
as
ADD
certain
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
main
ADD
facts,
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
Drebber
ADD
parted
ADD
from
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
station,
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
discovery
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
body
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
latter,
ADD
as
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
seen
ADD
them
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
eyes.
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
give
ADD
you
ADD
a
ADD
proof
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
knowledge.
ADD
Could
ADD
you
ADD
lay
ADD
your
ADD
hand
ADD
upon
ADD
those
ADD
pills?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
them,”
ADD
said
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
producing
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
white
ADD
box;
ADD
“I
ADD
took
ADD
them
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
purse
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
telegram,
ADD
intending
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
them
ADD
put
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
place
ADD
of
ADD
safety
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
Police
ADD
Station.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
merest
ADD
chance
ADD
my
ADD
taking
ADD
these
ADD
pills,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
bound
ADD
to
ADD
say
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
attach
ADD
any
ADD
importance
ADD
to
ADD
them.”
ADD

ADD
“Give
ADD
them
ADD
here,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes.
ADD
“Now,
ADD
Doctor,”
ADD
turning
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
“are
ADD
those
ADD
ordinary
ADD
pills?”
ADD

ADD
They
ADD
certainly
ADD
were
ADD
not.
ADD
They
ADD
were
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
pearly
ADD
grey
ADD
colour,
ADD
small,
ADD
round,
ADD
and
ADD
almost
ADD
transparent
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
light.
ADD
“From
ADD
their
ADD
lightness
ADD
and
ADD
transparency,
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
imagine
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
are
ADD
soluble
ADD
in
ADD
water,”
ADD
I
ADD
remarked.
ADD

ADD
“Precisely
ADD
so,”
ADD
answered
ADD
Holmes.
ADD
“Now
ADD
would
ADD
you
ADD
mind
ADD
going
ADD
down
ADD
and
ADD
fetching
ADD
that
ADD
poor
ADD
little
ADD
devil
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
terrier
ADD
which
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
bad
ADD
so
ADD
long,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
landlady
ADD
wanted
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
its
ADD
pain
ADD
yesterday.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
downstairs
ADD
and
ADD
carried
ADD
the
ADD
dog
ADD
upstair
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
arms.
ADD
It’s
ADD
laboured
ADD
breathing
ADD
and
ADD
glazing
ADD
eye
ADD
showed
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
far
ADD
from
ADD
its
ADD
end.
ADD
Indeed,
ADD
its
ADD
snow-white
ADD
muzzle
ADD
proclaimed
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
exceeded
ADD
the
ADD
usual
ADD
term
ADD
of
ADD
canine
ADD
existence.
ADD
I
ADD
placed
ADD
it
ADD
upon
ADD
a
ADD
cushion
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
rug.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
will
ADD
now
ADD
cut
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
pills
ADD
in
ADD
two,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
and
ADD
drawing
ADD
his
ADD
penknife
ADD
he
ADD
suited
ADD
the
ADD
action
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
word.
ADD
“One
ADD
half
ADD
we
ADD
return
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
box
ADD
for
ADD
future
ADD
purposes.
ADD
The
ADD
other
ADD
half
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
place
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
wine
ADD
glass,
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
teaspoonful
ADD
of
ADD
water.
ADD
You
ADD
perceive
ADD
that
ADD
our
ADD
friend,
ADD
the
ADD
Doctor,
ADD
is
ADD
right,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
readily
ADD
dissolves.”
ADD

ADD
“This
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
very
ADD
interesting,”
ADD
said
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
injured
ADD
tone
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
who
ADD
suspects
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
being
ADD
laughed
ADD
at,
ADD
“I
ADD
cannot
ADD
see,
ADD
however,
ADD
what
ADD
it
ADD
has
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson.”
ADD

ADD
“Patience,
ADD
my
ADD
friend,
ADD
patience!
ADD
You
ADD
will
ADD
find
ADD
in
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
has
ADD
everything
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
with
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
now
ADD
add
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
milk
ADD
to
ADD
make
ADD
the
ADD
mixture
ADD
palatable,
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
presenting
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
dog
ADD
we
ADD
find
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
laps
ADD
it
ADD
up
ADD
readily
ADD
enough.”
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
spoke
ADD
he
ADD
turned
ADD
the
ADD
contents
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
wine
ADD
glass
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
saucer
ADD
and
ADD
placed
ADD
it
ADD
in
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
terrier,
ADD
who
ADD
speedily
ADD
licked
ADD
it
ADD
dry.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes’
ADD
earnest
ADD
demeanour
ADD
had
ADD
so
ADD
far
ADD
convinced
ADD
us
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
all
ADD
sat
ADD
in
ADD
silence,
ADD
watching
ADD
the
ADD
animal
ADD
intently,
ADD
and
ADD
expecting
ADD
some
ADD
startling
ADD
effect.
ADD
None
ADD
such
ADD
appeared,
ADD
however.
ADD
The
ADD
dog
ADD
continued
ADD
to
ADD
lie
ADD
stretched
ADD
upon
ADD
tho
ADD
16
ADD
cushion,
ADD
breathing
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
laboured
ADD
way,
ADD
but
ADD
apparently
ADD
neither
ADD
the
ADD
better
ADD
nor
ADD
the
ADD
worse
ADD
for
ADD
its
ADD
draught.
ADD

ADD
Holmes
ADD
had
ADD
taken
ADD
out
ADD
his
ADD
watch,
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
minute
ADD
followed
ADD
minute
ADD
without
ADD
result,
ADD
an
ADD
expression
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
utmost
ADD
chagrin
ADD
and
ADD
disappointment
ADD
appeared
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
features.
ADD
He
ADD
gnawed
ADD
his
ADD
lip,
ADD
drummed
ADD
his
ADD
fingers
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
table,
ADD
and
ADD
showed
ADD
every
ADD
other
ADD
symptom
ADD
of
ADD
acute
ADD
impatience.
ADD
So
ADD
great
ADD
was
ADD
his
ADD
emotion,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
felt
ADD
sincerely
ADD
sorry
ADD
for
ADD
him,
ADD
while
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
detectives
ADD
smiled
ADD
derisively,
ADD
by
ADD
no
ADD
means
ADD
displeased
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
check
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
met.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
can’t
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
coincidence,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
springing
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
chair
ADD
and
ADD
pacing
ADD
wildly
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
room;
ADD
“it
ADD
is
ADD
impossible
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
mere
ADD
coincidence.
ADD
The
ADD
very
ADD
pills
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
suspected
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
of
ADD
Drebber
ADD
are
ADD
actually
ADD
found
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
Stangerson.
ADD
And
ADD
yet
ADD
they
ADD
are
ADD
inert.
ADD
What
ADD
can
ADD
it
ADD
mean?
ADD
Surely
ADD
my
ADD
whole
ADD
chain
ADD
of
ADD
reasoning
ADD
cannot
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
false.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
impossible!
ADD
And
ADD
yet
ADD
this
ADD
wretched
ADD
dog
ADD
is
ADD
none
ADD
the
ADD
worse.
ADD
Ah,
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
it!
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
it!”
ADD
With
ADD
a
ADD
perfect
ADD
shriek
ADD
of
ADD
delight
ADD
he
ADD
rushed
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
box,
ADD
cut
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
pill
ADD
in
ADD
two,
ADD
dissolved
ADD
it,
ADD
added
ADD
milk,
ADD
and
ADD
presented
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
terrier.
ADD
The
ADD
unfortunate
ADD
creature’s
ADD
tongue
ADD
seemed
ADD
hardly
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
moistened
ADD
in
ADD
it
ADD
before
ADD
it
ADD
gave
ADD
a
ADD
convulsive
ADD
shiver
ADD
in
ADD
every
ADD
limb,
ADD
and
ADD
lay
ADD
as
ADD
rigid
ADD
and
ADD
lifeless
ADD
as
ADD
if
ADD
it
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
struck
ADD
by
ADD
lightning.
ADD

ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
drew
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
breath,
ADD
and
ADD
wiped
ADD
the
ADD
perspiration
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
forehead.
ADD
“I
ADD
should
ADD
have
ADD
more
ADD
faith,”
ADD
he
ADD
said;
ADD
“I
ADD
ought
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
when
ADD
a
ADD
fact
ADD
appears
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
opposed
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
train
ADD
of
ADD
deductions,
ADD
it
ADD
invariably
ADD
proves
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
capable
ADD
of
ADD
bearing
ADD
some
ADD
other
ADD
interpretation.
ADD
Of
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
pills
ADD
in
ADD
that
ADD
box
ADD
one
ADD
was
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
deadly
ADD
poison,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
was
ADD
entirely
ADD
harmless.
ADD
I
ADD
ought
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
known
ADD
that
ADD
before
ADD
ever
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
box
ADD
at
ADD
all.”
ADD

ADD
This
ADD
last
ADD
statement
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
so
ADD
startling,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
hardly
ADD
believe
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
sober
ADD
senses.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
dead
ADD
dog,
ADD
however,
ADD
to
ADD
prove
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
conjecture
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
correct.
ADD
It
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
mists
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
mind
ADD
were
ADD
gradually
ADD
clearing
ADD
away,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
dim,
ADD
vague
ADD
perception
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
truth.
ADD

ADD
“All
ADD
this
ADD
seems
ADD
strange
ADD
to
ADD
you,”
ADD
continued
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
“because
ADD
you
ADD
failed
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
beginning
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
inquiry
ADD
to
ADD
grasp
ADD
the
ADD
importance
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
single
ADD
real
ADD
clue
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
presented
ADD
to
ADD
you.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
good
ADD
fortune
ADD
to
ADD
seize
ADD
upon
ADD
that,
ADD
and
ADD
everything
ADD
which
ADD
has
ADD
occurred
ADD
since
ADD
then
ADD
has
ADD
served
ADD
to
ADD
confirm
ADD
my
ADD
original
ADD
supposition,
ADD
and,
ADD
indeed,
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
logical
ADD
sequence
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
Hence
ADD
things
ADD
which
ADD
have
ADD
perplexed
ADD
you
ADD
and
ADD
made
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
more
ADD
obscure,
ADD
have
ADD
served
ADD
to
ADD
enlighten
ADD
me
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
strengthen
ADD
my
ADD
conclusions.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
mistake
ADD
to
ADD
confound
ADD
strangeness
ADD
with
ADD
mystery.
ADD
The
ADD
most
ADD
commonplace
ADD
crime
ADD
is
ADD
often
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
mysterious
ADD
because
ADD
it
ADD
presents
ADD
no
ADD
new
ADD
or
ADD
special
ADD
features
ADD
from
ADD
which
ADD
deductions
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
drawn.
ADD
This
ADD
murder
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
infinitely
ADD
more
ADD
difficult
ADD
to
ADD
unravel
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
body
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
victim
ADD
been
ADD
simply
ADD
found
ADD
lying
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
roadway
ADD
without
ADD
any
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
outré
ADD
and
ADD
sensational
ADD
accompaniments
ADD
which
ADD
have
ADD
rendered
ADD
it
ADD
remarkable.
ADD
These
ADD
strange
ADD
details,
ADD
far
ADD
from
ADD
making
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
more
ADD
difficult,
ADD
have
ADD
really
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
effect
ADD
of
ADD
making
ADD
it
ADD
less
ADD
so.”
ADD

ADD
Mr.
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
listened
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
address
ADD
with
ADD
considerable
ADD
impatience,
ADD
could
ADD
contain
ADD
himself
ADD
no
ADD
longer.
ADD
“Look
ADD
here,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“we
ADD
are
ADD
all
ADD
ready
ADD
to
ADD
acknowledge
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
a
ADD
smart
ADD
man,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
your
ADD
own
ADD
methods
ADD
of
ADD
working.
ADD
We
ADD
want
ADD
something
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
mere
ADD
theory
ADD
and
ADD
preaching
ADD
now,
ADD
though.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
case
ADD
of
ADD
taking
ADD
the
ADD
man.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
made
ADD
my
ADD
case
ADD
out,
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
seems
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
wrong.
ADD
Young
ADD
Charpentier
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
engaged
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
second
ADD
affair.
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
went
ADD
after
ADD
his
ADD
man,
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
appears
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
wrong
ADD
too.
ADD
You
ADD
have
ADD
thrown
ADD
out
ADD
hints
ADD
here,
ADD
and
ADD
hints
ADD
there,
ADD
and
ADD
seem
ADD
to
ADD
know
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
we
ADD
do,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
has
ADD
come
ADD
when
ADD
we
ADD
feel
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
right
ADD
to
ADD
ask
ADD
you
ADD
straight
ADD
how
ADD
much
ADD
you
ADD
do
ADD
know
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
business.
ADD
Can
ADD
you
ADD
name
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
did
ADD
it?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
cannot
ADD
help
ADD
feeling
ADD
that
ADD
Gregson
ADD
is
ADD
right,
ADD
sir,”
ADD
remarked
ADD
Lestrade.
ADD
“We
ADD
have
ADD
both
ADD
tried,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
both
ADD
failed.
ADD
You
ADD
have
ADD
remarked
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
once
ADD
since
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
had
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
evidence
ADD
which
ADD
you
ADD
require.
ADD
Surely
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
not
ADD
withhold
ADD
it
ADD
any
ADD
longer.”
ADD

ADD
“Any
ADD
delay
ADD
in
ADD
arresting
ADD
the
ADD
assassin,”
ADD
I
ADD
observed,
ADD
“might
ADD
give
ADD
him
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
perpetrate
ADD
some
ADD
fresh
ADD
atrocity.”
ADD

ADD
Thus
ADD
pressed
ADD
by
ADD
us
ADD
all,
ADD
Holmes
ADD
showed
ADD
signs
ADD
of
ADD
irresolution.
ADD
He
ADD
continued
ADD
to
ADD
walk
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
head
ADD
sunk
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
chest
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
brows
ADD
drawn
ADD
down,
ADD
as
ADD
was
ADD
his
ADD
habit
ADD
when
ADD
lost
ADD
in
ADD
thought.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
no
ADD
more
ADD
murders,”
ADD
he
ADD
said
ADD
at
ADD
last,
ADD
stopping
ADD
abruptly
ADD
and
ADD
facing
ADD
us.
ADD
“You
ADD
can
ADD
put
ADD
that
ADD
consideration
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
question.
ADD
You
ADD
have
ADD
asked
ADD
me
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
know
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
assassin.
ADD
I
ADD
do.
ADD
The
ADD
mere
ADD
knowing
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
name
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
thing,
ADD
however,
ADD
compared
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
power
ADD
of
ADD
laying
ADD
our
ADD
hands
ADD
upon
ADD
him.
ADD
This
ADD
I
ADD
expect
ADD
very
ADD
shortly
ADD
to
ADD
do.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
good
ADD
hopes
ADD
of
ADD
managing
ADD
it
ADD
through
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
arrangements;
ADD
but
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
thing
ADD
which
ADD
needs
ADD
delicate
ADD
handling,
ADD
for
ADD
we
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
shrewd
ADD
and
ADD
desperate
ADD
man
ADD
to
ADD
deal
ADD
with,
ADD
who
ADD
is
ADD
supported,
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
occasion
ADD
to
ADD
prove,
ADD
by
ADD
another
ADD
who
ADD
is
ADD
as
ADD
clever
ADD
as
ADD
himself.
ADD
As
ADD
long
ADD
as
ADD
this
ADD
man
ADD
has
ADD
no
ADD
idea
ADD
that
ADD
anyone
ADD
can
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
clue
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
some
ADD
chance
ADD
of
ADD
securing
ADD
him;
ADD
but
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
slightest
ADD
suspicion,
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
change
ADD
his
ADD
name,
ADD
and
ADD
vanish
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
instant
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
four
ADD
million
ADD
inhabitants
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
great
ADD
city.
ADD
Without
ADD
meaning
ADD
to
ADD
hurt
ADD
either
ADD
of
ADD
your
ADD
feelings,
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
bound
ADD
to
ADD
say
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
consider
ADD
these
ADD
men
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
a
ADD
match
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
official
ADD
force,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
is
ADD
why
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
not
ADD
asked
ADD
your
ADD
assistance.
ADD
If
ADD
I
ADD
fail
ADD
I
ADD
shall,
ADD
of
ADD
course,
ADD
incur
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
blame
ADD
due
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
omission;
ADD
but
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
prepared
ADD
for.
ADD
At
ADD
present
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
ready
ADD
to
ADD
promise
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
instant
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
communicate
ADD
with
ADD
you
ADD
without
ADD
endangering
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
combinations,
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
do
ADD
so.”
ADD

ADD
Gregson
ADD
and
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
far
ADD
from
ADD
satisfied
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
assurance,
ADD
or
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
depreciating
ADD
allusion
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
detective
ADD
police.
ADD
The
ADD
former
ADD
had
ADD
flushed
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
roots
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
flaxen
ADD
hair,
ADD
while
ADD
the
ADD
other’s
ADD
beady
ADD
eyes
ADD
glistened
ADD
with
ADD
curiosity
ADD
and
ADD
resentment.
ADD
Neither
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
had
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
speak,
ADD
however,
ADD
before
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
tap
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
spokesman
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
street
ADD
Arabs,
ADD
young
ADD
Wiggins,
ADD
introduced
ADD
his
ADD
insignificant
ADD
and
ADD
unsavoury
ADD
person.
ADD

ADD
“Please,
ADD
sir,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
touching
ADD
his
ADD
forelock,
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
cab
ADD
downstairs.”
ADD

ADD
“Good
ADD
boy,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
blandly.
ADD
“Why
ADD
don’t
ADD
you
ADD
introduce
ADD
this
ADD
pattern
ADD
at
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yard?”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
taking
ADD
a
ADD
pair
ADD
of
ADD
steel
ADD
handcuffs
ADD
from
ADD
a
ADD
drawer.
ADD
“See
ADD
how
ADD
beautifully
ADD
the
ADD
spring
ADD
works.
ADD
They
ADD
fasten
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
instant.”
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
old
ADD
pattern
ADD
is
ADD
good
ADD
enough,”
ADD
remarked
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
“if
ADD
we
ADD
can
ADD
only
ADD
find
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
them
ADD
on.”
ADD

ADD
“Very
ADD
good,
ADD
very
ADD
good,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
smiling.
ADD
“The
ADD
cabman
ADD
may
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
help
ADD
me
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
boxes.
ADD
Just
ADD
ask
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
step
ADD
up,
ADD
Wiggins.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
surprised
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
my
ADD
companion
ADD
speaking
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
he
ADD
were
ADD
about
ADD
to
ADD
set
ADD
out
ADD
on
ADD
a
ADD
journey,
ADD
since
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
said
ADD
anything
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
about
ADD
it.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
portmanteau
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
and
ADD
this
ADD
he
ADD
pulled
ADD
out
ADD
and
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
strap.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
busily
ADD
engaged
ADD
at
ADD
it
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
cabman
ADD
entered
ADD
the
ADD
room.
ADD

ADD
“Just
ADD
give
ADD
me
ADD
a
ADD
help
ADD
with
ADD
this
ADD
buckle,
ADD
cabman,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
kneeling
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
task,
ADD
and
ADD
never
ADD
turning
ADD
his
ADD
head.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
fellow
ADD
came
ADD
forward
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
somewhat
ADD
sullen,
ADD
defiant
ADD
air,
ADD
and
ADD
put
ADD
down
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
to
ADD
assist.
ADD
At
ADD
that
ADD
instant
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
sharp
ADD
click,
ADD
the
ADD
jangling
ADD
of
ADD
metal,
ADD
and
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
sprang
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
feet
ADD
again.
ADD

ADD
“Gentlemen,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
with
ADD
flashing
ADD
eyes,
ADD
“let
ADD
me
ADD
introduce
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,
ADD
the
ADD
murderer
ADD
of
ADD
Enoch
ADD
Drebber
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
whole
ADD
thing
ADD
occurred
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
moment—so
ADD
quickly
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
realize
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
vivid
ADD
recollection
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
instant,
ADD
of
ADD
Holmes’
ADD
triumphant
ADD
expression
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
ring
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
voice,
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
cabman’s
ADD
dazed,
ADD
savage
ADD
face,
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
glared
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
glittering
ADD
handcuffs,
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
appeared
ADD
as
ADD
if
ADD
by
ADD
magic
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
wrists.
ADD
For
ADD
a
ADD
second
ADD
or
ADD
two
ADD
we
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
group
ADD
of
ADD
statues.
ADD
Then,
ADD
with
ADD
an
ADD
inarticulate
ADD
roar
ADD
of
ADD
fury,
ADD
the
ADD
prisoner
ADD
wrenched
ADD
himself
ADD
free
ADD
from
ADD
Holmes’s
ADD
grasp,
ADD
and
ADD
hurled
ADD
himself
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
window.
ADD
Woodwork
ADD
and
ADD
glass
ADD
gave
ADD
way
ADD
before
ADD
him;
ADD
but
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
got
ADD
quite
ADD
through,
ADD
Gregson,
ADD
Lestrade,
ADD
and
ADD
Holmes
ADD
sprang
ADD
upon
ADD
him
ADD
like
ADD
so
ADD
many
ADD
staghounds.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
dragged
ADD
back
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
commenced
ADD
a
ADD
terrific
ADD
conflict.
ADD
So
ADD
powerful
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
fierce
ADD
was
ADD
he,
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
four
ADD
of
ADD
us
ADD
were
ADD
shaken
ADD
off
ADD
again
ADD
and
ADD
again.
ADD
He
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
convulsive
ADD
strength
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
epileptic
ADD
fit.
ADD
His
ADD
face
ADD
and
ADD
hands
ADD
were
ADD
terribly
ADD
mangled
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
passage
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
glass,
ADD
but
ADD
loss
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
effect
ADD
in
ADD
diminishing
ADD
his
ADD
resistance.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
until
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
succeeded
ADD
in
ADD
getting
ADD
his
ADD
hand
ADD
inside
ADD
his
ADD
neckcloth
ADD
and
ADD
half-strangling
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
made
ADD
him
ADD
realize
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
struggles
ADD
were
ADD
of
ADD
no
ADD
avail;
ADD
and
ADD
even
ADD
then
ADD
we
ADD
felt
ADD
no
ADD
security
ADD
until
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
pinioned
ADD
his
ADD
feet
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
as
ADD
his
ADD
hands.
ADD
That
ADD
done,
ADD
we
ADD
rose
ADD
to
ADD
our
ADD
feet
ADD
breathless
ADD
and
ADD
panting.
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
have
ADD
his
ADD
cab,”
ADD
said
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD
“It
ADD
will
ADD
serve
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yard.
ADD
And
ADD
now,
ADD
gentlemen,”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
pleasant
ADD
smile,
ADD
“we
ADD
have
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
little
ADD
mystery.
ADD
You
ADD
are
ADD
very
ADD
welcome
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
any
ADD
questions
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
like
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
now,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
danger
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
refuse
ADD
to
ADD
answer
ADD
them.”

ADD

ADD

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
I.
ADD
ON
ADD
THE
ADD
GREAT
ADD
ALKALI
ADD
PLAIN.
ADD

ADD
IN
ADD
the
ADD
central
ADD
portion
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
North
ADD
American
ADD
Continent
ADD
there
ADD
lies
ADD
an
ADD
arid
ADD
and
ADD
repulsive
ADD
desert,
ADD
which
ADD
for
ADD
many
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
year
ADD
served
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
barrier
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
advance
ADD
of
ADD
civilisation.
ADD
From
ADD
the
ADD
Sierra
ADD
Nevada
ADD
to
ADD
Nebraska,
ADD
and
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
Yellowstone
ADD
River
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
north
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Colorado
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
south,
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
region
ADD
of
ADD
desolation
ADD
and
ADD
silence.
ADD
Nor
ADD
is
ADD
Nature
ADD
always
ADD
in
ADD
one
ADD
mood
ADD
throughout
ADD
this
ADD
grim
ADD
district.
ADD
It
ADD
comprises
ADD
snow-capped
ADD
and
ADD
lofty
ADD
mountains,
ADD
and
ADD
dark
ADD
and
ADD
gloomy
ADD
valleys.
ADD
There
ADD
are
ADD
swift-flowing
ADD
rivers
ADD
which
ADD
dash
ADD
through
ADD
jagged
ADD
cañons;
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
are
ADD
enormous
ADD
plains,
ADD
which
ADD
in
ADD
winter
ADD
are
ADD
white
ADD
with
ADD
snow,
ADD
and
ADD
in
ADD
summer
ADD
are
ADD
grey
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
saline
ADD
alkali
ADD
dust.
ADD
They
ADD
all
ADD
preserve,
ADD
however,
ADD
the
ADD
common
ADD
characteristics
ADD
of
ADD
barrenness,
ADD
inhospitality,
ADD
and
ADD
misery.
ADD

ADD
There
ADD
are
ADD
no
ADD
inhabitants
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
land
ADD
of
ADD
despair.
ADD
A
ADD
band
ADD
of
ADD
Pawnees
ADD
or
ADD
of
ADD
Blackfeet
ADD
may
ADD
occasionally
ADD
traverse
ADD
it
ADD
in
ADD
order
ADD
to
ADD
reach
ADD
other
ADD
hunting-grounds,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
hardiest
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
braves
ADD
are
ADD
glad
ADD
to
ADD
lose
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
awesome
ADD
plains,
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
themselves
ADD
once
ADD
more
ADD
upon
ADD
their
ADD
prairies.
ADD
The
ADD
coyote
ADD
skulks
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
scrub,
ADD
the
ADD
buzzard
ADD
flaps
ADD
heavily
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
air,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
clumsy
ADD
grizzly
ADD
bear
ADD
lumbers
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
dark
ADD
ravines,
ADD
and
ADD
picks
ADD
up
ADD
such
ADD
sustenance
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
can
ADD
amongst
ADD
the
ADD
rocks.
ADD
These
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
sole
ADD
dwellers
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
wilderness.
ADD

ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
world
ADD
there
ADD
can
ADD
be
ADD
no
ADD
more
ADD
dreary
ADD
view
ADD
than
ADD
that
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
northern
ADD
slope
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Sierra
ADD
Blanco.
ADD
As
ADD
far
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
eye
ADD
can
ADD
reach
ADD
stretches
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
flat
ADD
plain-land,
ADD
all
ADD
dusted
ADD
over
ADD
with
ADD
patches
ADD
of
ADD
alkali,
ADD
and
ADD
intersected
ADD
by
ADD
clumps
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
dwarfish
ADD
chaparral
ADD
bushes.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
extreme
ADD
verge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
horizon
ADD
lie
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
chain
ADD
of
ADD
mountain
ADD
peaks,
ADD
with
ADD
their
ADD
rugged
ADD
summits
ADD
flecked
ADD
with
ADD
snow.
ADD
In
ADD
this
ADD
great
ADD
stretch
ADD
of
ADD
country
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
sign
ADD
of
ADD
life,
ADD
nor
ADD
of
ADD
anything
ADD
appertaining
ADD
to
ADD
life.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
bird
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
steel-blue
ADD
heaven,
ADD
no
ADD
movement
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
dull,
ADD
grey
ADD
earth—above
ADD
all,
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
absolute
ADD
silence.
ADD
Listen
ADD
as
ADD
one
ADD
may,
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
shadow
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
sound
ADD
in
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
mighty
ADD
wilderness;
ADD
nothing
ADD
but
ADD
silence—complete
ADD
and
ADD
heart-subduing
ADD
silence.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
said
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
nothing
ADD
appertaining
ADD
to
ADD
life
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
broad
ADD
plain.
ADD
That
ADD
is
ADD
hardly
ADD
true.
ADD
Looking
ADD
down
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
Sierra
ADD
Blanco,
ADD
one
ADD
sees
ADD
a
ADD
pathway
ADD
traced
ADD
out
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
desert,
ADD
which
ADD
winds
ADD
away
ADD
and
ADD
is
ADD
lost
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
extreme
ADD
distance.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
rutted
ADD
with
ADD
wheels
ADD
and
ADD
trodden
ADD
down
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
feet
ADD
of
ADD
many
ADD
adventurers.
ADD
Here
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
there
ADD
are
ADD
scattered
ADD
white
ADD
objects
ADD
which
ADD
glisten
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
sun,
ADD
and
ADD
stand
ADD
out
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
dull
ADD
deposit
ADD
of
ADD
alkali.
ADD
Approach,
ADD
and
ADD
examine
ADD
them!
ADD
They
ADD
are
ADD
bones:
ADD
some
ADD
large
ADD
and
ADD
coarse,
ADD
others
ADD
smaller
ADD
and
ADD
more
ADD
delicate.
ADD
The
ADD
former
ADD
have
ADD
belonged
ADD
to
ADD
oxen,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
latter
ADD
to
ADD
men.
ADD
For
ADD
fifteen
ADD
hundred
ADD
miles
ADD
one
ADD
may
ADD
trace
ADD
this
ADD
ghastly
ADD
caravan
ADD
route
ADD
by
ADD
these
ADD
scattered
ADD
remains
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
fallen
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
wayside.
ADD

ADD
Looking
ADD
down
ADD
on
ADD
this
ADD
very
ADD
scene,
ADD
there
ADD
stood
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
fourth
ADD
of
ADD
May,
ADD
eighteen
ADD
hundred
ADD
and
ADD
forty-seven,
ADD
a
ADD
solitary
ADD
traveller.
ADD
His
ADD
appearance
ADD
was
ADD
such
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
genius
ADD
or
ADD
demon
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
region.
ADD
An
ADD
observer
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
found
ADD
it
ADD
difficult
ADD
to
ADD
say
ADD
whether
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
nearer
ADD
to
ADD
forty
ADD
or
ADD
to
ADD
sixty.
ADD
His
ADD
face
ADD
was
ADD
lean
ADD
and
ADD
haggard,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
brown
ADD
parchment-like
ADD
skin
ADD
was
ADD
drawn
ADD
tightly
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
projecting
ADD
bones;
ADD
his
ADD
long,
ADD
brown
ADD
hair
ADD
and
ADD
beard
ADD
were
ADD
all
ADD
flecked
ADD
and
ADD
dashed
ADD
with
ADD
white;
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
were
ADD
sunken
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
head,
ADD
and
ADD
burned
ADD
with
ADD
an
ADD
unnatural
ADD
lustre;
ADD
while
ADD
the
ADD
hand
ADD
which
ADD
grasped
ADD
his
ADD
rifle
ADD
was
ADD
hardly
ADD
more
ADD
fleshy
ADD
than
ADD
that
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
skeleton.
ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
stood,
ADD
he
ADD
leaned
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
weapon
ADD
for
ADD
support,
ADD
and
ADD
yet
ADD
his
ADD
tall
ADD
figure
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
massive
ADD
framework
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
bones
ADD
suggested
ADD
a
ADD
wiry
ADD
and
ADD
vigorous
ADD
constitution.
ADD
His
ADD
gaunt
ADD
face,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
clothes,
ADD
which
ADD
hung
ADD
so
ADD
baggily
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
shrivelled
ADD
limbs,
ADD
proclaimed
ADD
what
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
gave
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
senile
ADD
and
ADD
decrepit
ADD
appearance.
ADD
The
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
dying—dying
ADD
from
ADD
hunger
ADD
and
ADD
from
ADD
thirst.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
toiled
ADD
painfully
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
ravine,
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
little
ADD
elevation,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
vain
ADD
hope
ADD
of
ADD
seeing
ADD
some
ADD
signs
ADD
of
ADD
water.
ADD
Now
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
salt
ADD
plain
ADD
stretched
ADD
before
ADD
his
ADD
eyes,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
distant
ADD
belt
ADD
of
ADD
savage
ADD
mountains,
ADD
without
ADD
a
ADD
sign
ADD
anywhere
ADD
of
ADD
plant
ADD
or
ADD
tree,
ADD
which
ADD
might
ADD
indicate
ADD
the
ADD
presence
ADD
of
ADD
moisture.
ADD
In
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
broad
ADD
landscape
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
gleam
ADD
of
ADD
hope.
ADD
North,
ADD
and
ADD
east,
ADD
and
ADD
west
ADD
he
ADD
looked
ADD
with
ADD
wild
ADD
questioning
ADD
eyes,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
he
ADD
realised
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
wanderings
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
an
ADD
end,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
there,
ADD
on
ADD
that
ADD
barren
ADD
crag,
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
about
ADD
to
ADD
die.
ADD
“Why
ADD
not
ADD
here,
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
as
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
feather
ADD
bed,
ADD
twenty
ADD
years
ADD
hence,”
ADD
he
ADD
muttered,
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
seated
ADD
himself
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
shelter
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
boulder.
ADD

ADD
Before
ADD
sitting
ADD
down,
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
deposited
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
ground
ADD
his
ADD
useless
ADD
rifle,
ADD
and
ADD
also
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
bundle
ADD
tied
ADD
up
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
grey
ADD
shawl,
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
carried
ADD
slung
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
right
ADD
shoulder.
ADD
It
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
somewhat
ADD
too
ADD
heavy
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
strength,
ADD
for
ADD
in
ADD
lowering
ADD
it,
ADD
it
ADD
came
ADD
down
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
ground
ADD
with
ADD
some
ADD
little
ADD
violence.
ADD
Instantly
ADD
there
ADD
broke
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
grey
ADD
parcel
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
moaning
ADD
cry,
ADD
and
ADD
from
ADD
it
ADD
there
ADD
protruded
ADD
a
ADD
small,
ADD
scared
ADD
face,
ADD
with
ADD
very
ADD
bright
ADD
brown
ADD
eyes,
ADD
and
ADD
two
ADD
little
ADD
speckled,
ADD
dimpled
ADD
fists.
ADD

ADD
“You’ve
ADD
hurt
ADD
me!”
ADD
said
ADD
a
ADD
childish
ADD
voice
ADD
reproachfully.
ADD

ADD
“Have
ADD
I
ADD
though,”
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
answered
ADD
penitently,
ADD
“I
ADD
didn’t
ADD
go
ADD
for
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
it.”
ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
spoke
ADD
he
ADD
unwrapped
ADD
the
ADD
grey
ADD
shawl
ADD
and
ADD
extricated
ADD
a
ADD
pretty
ADD
little
ADD
girl
ADD
of
ADD
about
ADD
five
ADD
years
ADD
of
ADD
age,
ADD
whose
ADD
dainty
ADD
shoes
ADD
and
ADD
smart
ADD
pink
ADD
frock
ADD
with
ADD
its
ADD
little
ADD
linen
ADD
apron
ADD
all
ADD
bespoke
ADD
a
ADD
mother’s
ADD
care.
ADD
The
ADD
child
ADD
was
ADD
pale
ADD
and
ADD
wan,
ADD
but
ADD
her
ADD
healthy
ADD
arms
ADD
and
ADD
legs
ADD
showed
ADD
that
ADD
she
ADD
had
ADD
suffered
ADD
less
ADD
than
ADD
her
ADD
companion.
ADD

ADD
“How
ADD
is
ADD
it
ADD
now?”
ADD
he
ADD
answered
ADD
anxiously,
ADD
for
ADD
she
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
rubbing
ADD
the
ADD
towsy
ADD
golden
ADD
curls
ADD
which
ADD
covered
ADD
the
ADD
back
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
head.
ADD

ADD
“Kiss
ADD
it
ADD
and
ADD
make
ADD
it
ADD
well,”
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
with
ADD
perfect
ADD
gravity,
ADD
shoving
ADD
19
ADD
the
ADD
injured
ADD
part
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
“That’s
ADD
what
ADD
mother
ADD
used
ADD
to
ADD
do.
ADD
Where’s
ADD
mother?”
ADD

ADD
“Mother’s
ADD
gone.
ADD
I
ADD
guess
ADD
you’ll
ADD
see
ADD
her
ADD
before
ADD
long.”
ADD

ADD
“Gone,
ADD
eh!”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
girl.
ADD
“Funny,
ADD
she
ADD
didn’t
ADD
say
ADD
good-bye;
ADD
she
ADD
‘most
ADD
always
ADD
did
ADD
if
ADD
she
ADD
was
ADD
just
ADD
goin’
ADD
over
ADD
to
ADD
Auntie’s
ADD
for
ADD
tea,
ADD
and
ADD
now
ADD
she’s
ADD
been
ADD
away
ADD
three
ADD
days.
ADD
Say,
ADD
it’s
ADD
awful
ADD
dry,
ADD
ain’t
ADD
it?
ADD
Ain’t
ADD
there
ADD
no
ADD
water,
ADD
nor
ADD
nothing
ADD
to
ADD
eat?”
ADD

ADD
“No,
ADD
there
ADD
ain’t
ADD
nothing,
ADD
dearie.
ADD
You’ll
ADD
just
ADD
need
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
patient
ADD
awhile,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
you’ll
ADD
be
ADD
all
ADD
right.
ADD
Put
ADD
your
ADD
head
ADD
up
ADD
agin
ADD
me
ADD
like
ADD
that,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
you’ll
ADD
feel
ADD
bullier.
ADD
It
ADD
ain’t
ADD
easy
ADD
to
ADD
talk
ADD
when
ADD
your
ADD
lips
ADD
is
ADD
like
ADD
leather,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
guess
ADD
I’d
ADD
best
ADD
let
ADD
you
ADD
know
ADD
how
ADD
the
ADD
cards
ADD
lie.
ADD
What’s
ADD
that
ADD
you’ve
ADD
got?”
ADD

ADD
“Pretty
ADD
things!
ADD
fine
ADD
things!”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
girl
ADD
enthusiastically,
ADD
holding
ADD
up
ADD
two
ADD
glittering
ADD
fragments
ADD
of
ADD
mica.
ADD
“When
ADD
we
ADD
goes
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
home
ADD
I’ll
ADD
give
ADD
them
ADD
to
ADD
brother
ADD
Bob.”
ADD

ADD
“You’ll
ADD
see
ADD
prettier
ADD
things
ADD
than
ADD
them
ADD
soon,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
confidently.
ADD
“You
ADD
just
ADD
wait
ADD
a
ADD
bit.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
though—you
ADD
remember
ADD
when
ADD
we
ADD
left
ADD
the
ADD
river?”
ADD

ADD
“Oh,
ADD
yes.”
ADD

ADD
“Well,
ADD
we
ADD
reckoned
ADD
we’d
ADD
strike
ADD
another
ADD
river
ADD
soon,
ADD
d’ye
ADD
see.
ADD
But
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
somethin’
ADD
wrong;
ADD
compasses,
ADD
or
ADD
map,
ADD
or
ADD
somethin’,
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
didn’t
ADD
turn
ADD
up.
ADD
Water
ADD
ran
ADD
out.
ADD
Just
ADD
except
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
drop
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
likes
ADD
of
ADD
you
ADD
and—and——”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
you
ADD
couldn’t
ADD
wash
ADD
yourself,”
ADD
interrupted
ADD
his
ADD
companion
ADD
gravely,
ADD
staring
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
grimy
ADD
visage.
ADD

ADD
“No,
ADD
nor
ADD
drink.
ADD
And
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Bender,
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
fust
ADD
to
ADD
go,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
Indian
ADD
Pete,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
Mrs.
ADD
McGregor,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
Johnny
ADD
Hones,
ADD
and
ADD
then,
ADD
dearie,
ADD
your
ADD
mother.”
ADD

ADD
“Then
ADD
mother’s
ADD
a
ADD
deader
ADD
too,”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
girl
ADD
dropping
ADD
her
ADD
face
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
pinafore
ADD
and
ADD
sobbing
ADD
bitterly.
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
they
ADD
all
ADD
went
ADD
except
ADD
you
ADD
and
ADD
me.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
some
ADD
chance
ADD
of
ADD
water
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
direction,
ADD
so
ADD
I
ADD
heaved
ADD
you
ADD
over
ADD
my
ADD
shoulder
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
tramped
ADD
it
ADD
together.
ADD
It
ADD
don’t
ADD
seem
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
we’ve
ADD
improved
ADD
matters.
ADD
There’s
ADD
an
ADD
almighty
ADD
small
ADD
chance
ADD
for
ADD
us
ADD
now!”
ADD

ADD
“Do
ADD
you
ADD
mean
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
die
ADD
too?”
ADD
asked
ADD
the
ADD
child,
ADD
checking
ADD
her
ADD
sobs,
ADD
and
ADD
raising
ADD
her
ADD
tear-stained
ADD
face.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
guess
ADD
that’s
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
size
ADD
of
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“Why
ADD
didn’t
ADD
you
ADD
say
ADD
so
ADD
before?”
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
laughing
ADD
gleefully.
ADD
“You
ADD
gave
ADD
me
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
fright.
ADD
Why,
ADD
of
ADD
course,
ADD
now
ADD
as
ADD
long
ADD
as
ADD
we
ADD
die
ADD
we’ll
ADD
be
ADD
with
ADD
mother
ADD
again.”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
you
ADD
will,
ADD
dearie.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
you
ADD
too.
ADD
I’ll
ADD
tell
ADD
her
ADD
how
ADD
awful
ADD
good
ADD
you’ve
ADD
been.
ADD
I’ll
ADD
bet
ADD
she
ADD
meets
ADD
us
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
of
ADD
Heaven
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
big
ADD
pitcher
ADD
of
ADD
water,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
lot
ADD
of
ADD
buckwheat
ADD
cakes,
ADD
hot,
ADD
and
ADD
toasted
ADD
on
ADD
both
ADD
sides,
ADD
like
ADD
Bob
ADD
and
ADD
me
ADD
was
ADD
fond
ADD
of.
ADD
How
ADD
long
ADD
will
ADD
it
ADD
be
ADD
first?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
don’t
ADD
know—not
ADD
very
ADD
long.”
ADD
The
ADD
man’s
ADD
eyes
ADD
were
ADD
fixed
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
northern
ADD
horizon.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
blue
ADD
vault
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
heaven
ADD
there
ADD
had
ADD
appeared
ADD
three
ADD
little
ADD
specks
ADD
which
ADD
increased
ADD
in
ADD
size
ADD
every
ADD
moment,
ADD
so
ADD
rapidly
ADD
did
ADD
they
ADD
approach.
ADD
They
ADD
speedily
ADD
resolved
ADD
themselves
ADD
into
ADD
three
ADD
large
ADD
brown
ADD
birds,
ADD
which
ADD
circled
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
heads
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
wanderers,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
settled
ADD
upon
ADD
some
ADD
rocks
ADD
which
ADD
overlooked
ADD
them.
ADD
They
ADD
were
ADD
buzzards,
ADD
the
ADD
vultures
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
west,
ADD
whose
ADD
coming
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
forerunner
ADD
of
ADD
death.
ADD

ADD
“Cocks
ADD
and
ADD
hens,”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
girl
ADD
gleefully,
ADD
pointing
ADD
at
ADD
their
ADD
ill-omened
ADD
forms,
ADD
and
ADD
clapping
ADD
her
ADD
hands
ADD
to
ADD
make
ADD
them
ADD
rise.
ADD
“Say,
ADD
did
ADD
God
ADD
make
ADD
this
ADD
country?”
ADD

ADD
“In
ADD
course
ADD
He
ADD
did,”
ADD
said
ADD
her
ADD
companion,
ADD
rather
ADD
startled
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
unexpected
ADD
question.
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
made
ADD
the
ADD
country
ADD
down
ADD
in
ADD
Illinois,
ADD
and
ADD
He
ADD
made
ADD
the
ADD
Missouri,”
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
girl
ADD
continued.
ADD
“I
ADD
guess
ADD
somebody
ADD
else
ADD
made
ADD
the
ADD
country
ADD
in
ADD
these
ADD
parts.
ADD
It’s
ADD
not
ADD
nearly
ADD
so
ADD
well
ADD
done.
ADD
They
ADD
forgot
ADD
the
ADD
water
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
trees.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
would
ADD
ye
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
offering
ADD
up
ADD
prayer?”
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
asked
ADD
diffidently.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
ain’t
ADD
night
ADD
yet,”
ADD
she
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
don’t
ADD
matter.
ADD
It
ADD
ain’t
ADD
quite
ADD
regular,
ADD
but
ADD
He
ADD
won’t
ADD
mind
ADD
that,
ADD
you
ADD
bet.
ADD
You
ADD
say
ADD
over
ADD
them
ADD
ones
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
used
ADD
to
ADD
say
ADD
every
ADD
night
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
waggon
ADD
when
ADD
we
ADD
was
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
Plains.”
ADD

ADD
“Why
ADD
don’t
ADD
you
ADD
say
ADD
some
ADD
yourself?”
ADD
the
ADD
child
ADD
asked,
ADD
with
ADD
wondering
ADD
eyes.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
disremember
ADD
them,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD
“I
ADD
hain’t
ADD
said
ADD
none
ADD
since
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
half
ADD
the
ADD
height
ADD
o’
ADD
that
ADD
gun.
ADD
I
ADD
guess
ADD
it’s
ADD
never
ADD
too
ADD
late.
ADD
You
ADD
say
ADD
them
ADD
out,
ADD
and
ADD
I’ll
ADD
stand
ADD
by
ADD
and
ADD
come
ADD
in
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
choruses.”
ADD

ADD
“Then
ADD
you’ll
ADD
need
ADD
to
ADD
kneel
ADD
down,
ADD
and
ADD
me
ADD
too,”
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
laying
ADD
the
ADD
shawl
ADD
out
ADD
for
ADD
that
ADD
purpose.
ADD
“You’ve
ADD
got
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
your
ADD
hands
ADD
up
ADD
like
ADD
this.
ADD
It
ADD
makes
ADD
you
ADD
feel
ADD
kind
ADD
o’
ADD
good.”
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
strange
ADD
sight
ADD
had
ADD
there
ADD
been
ADD
anything
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
buzzards
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
it.
ADD
Side
ADD
by
ADD
side
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
narrow
ADD
shawl
ADD
knelt
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
wanderers,
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
prattling
ADD
child
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
reckless,
ADD
hardened
ADD
adventurer.
ADD
Her
ADD
chubby
ADD
face,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
haggard,
ADD
angular
ADD
visage
ADD
were
ADD
both
ADD
turned
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
cloudless
ADD
heaven
ADD
in
ADD
heartfelt
ADD
entreaty
ADD
to
ADD
that
ADD
dread
ADD
being
ADD
with
ADD
whom
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
face
ADD
to
ADD
face,
ADD
while
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
voices—the
ADD
one
ADD
thin
ADD
and
ADD
clear,
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
deep
ADD
and
ADD
harsh—united
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
entreaty
ADD
for
ADD
mercy
ADD
and
ADD
forgiveness.
ADD
The
ADD
prayer
ADD
finished,
ADD
they
ADD
resumed
ADD
their
ADD
seat
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
shadow
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
boulder
ADD
until
ADD
the
ADD
child
ADD
fell
ADD
asleep,
ADD
nestling
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
broad
ADD
breast
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
protector.
ADD
He
ADD
watched
ADD
over
ADD
her
ADD
slumber
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
time,
ADD
but
ADD
Nature
ADD
proved
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
too
ADD
strong
ADD
for
ADD
him.
ADD
For
ADD
three
ADD
days
ADD
and
ADD
three
ADD
nights
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
allowed
ADD
himself
ADD
neither
ADD
rest
ADD
nor
ADD
repose.
ADD
Slowly
ADD
the
ADD
eyelids
ADD
drooped
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
tired
ADD
eyes,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
head
ADD
sunk
ADD
lower
ADD
and
ADD
lower
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
breast,
ADD
until
ADD
the
ADD
man’s
ADD
grizzled
ADD
beard
ADD
was
ADD
mixed
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
gold
ADD
tresses
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
companion,
ADD
and
ADD
both
ADD
slept
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
deep
ADD
and
ADD
dreamless
ADD
slumber.
ADD

ADD
Had
ADD
the
ADD
wanderer
ADD
remained
ADD
awake
ADD
for
ADD
another
ADD
half
ADD
hour
ADD
a
ADD
strange
ADD
sight
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
met
ADD
his
ADD
eyes.
ADD
Far
ADD
away
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
extreme
ADD
verge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
alkali
ADD
plain
ADD
there
ADD
rose
ADD
up
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
spray
ADD
of
ADD
dust,
ADD
very
ADD
slight
ADD
at
ADD
first,
ADD
and
ADD
hardly
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
distinguished
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
mists
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
distance,
ADD
but
ADD
gradually
ADD
growing
ADD
higher
ADD
and
ADD
broader
ADD
until
ADD
it
ADD
formed
ADD
a
ADD
solid,
ADD
well-defined
ADD
cloud.
ADD
This
ADD
cloud
ADD
continued
ADD
to
ADD
increase
ADD
in
ADD
size
ADD
until
ADD
it
ADD
became
ADD
evident
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
could
ADD
only
ADD
be
ADD
raised
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
multitude
ADD
of
ADD
moving
ADD
creatures.
ADD
In
ADD
more
ADD
fertile
ADD
spots
ADD
the
ADD
observer
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
conclusion
ADD
that
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
great
ADD
herds
ADD
of
ADD
bisons
ADD
which
ADD
graze
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
prairie
ADD
land
ADD
was
ADD
approaching
ADD
him.
ADD
This
ADD
was
ADD
obviously
ADD
impossible
ADD
in
ADD
these
ADD
arid
ADD
wilds.
ADD
As
ADD
the
ADD
whirl
ADD
of
ADD
dust
ADD
drew
ADD
nearer
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
solitary
ADD
bluff
ADD
upon
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
castaways
ADD
were
ADD
reposing,
ADD
the
ADD
canvas-covered
ADD
tilts
ADD
of
ADD
waggons
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
figures
ADD
of
ADD
armed
ADD
horsemen
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
show
ADD
up
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
haze,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
apparition
ADD
revealed
ADD
itself
ADD
as
ADD
being
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
caravan
ADD
upon
ADD
its
ADD
journey
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
West.
ADD
But
ADD
what
ADD
a
ADD
caravan!
ADD
When
ADD
the
ADD
head
ADD
of
ADD
it
ADD
had
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
base
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mountains,
ADD
the
ADD
rear
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
yet
ADD
visible
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
horizon.
ADD
Right
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
enormous
ADD
plain
ADD
stretched
ADD
the
ADD
straggling
ADD
array,
ADD
waggons
ADD
and
ADD
carts,
ADD
men
ADD
on
ADD
horseback,
ADD
and
ADD
men
ADD
on
ADD
foot.
ADD
Innumerable
ADD
women
ADD
who
ADD
staggered
ADD
along
ADD
under
ADD
burdens,
ADD
and
ADD
children
ADD
who
ADD
toddled
ADD
beside
ADD
the
ADD
waggons
ADD
or
ADD
peeped
ADD
out
ADD
from
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
white
ADD
coverings.
ADD
This
ADD
was
ADD
evidently
ADD
no
ADD
ordinary
ADD
party
ADD
of
ADD
immigrants,
ADD
but
ADD
rather
ADD
some
ADD
nomad
ADD
people
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
compelled
ADD
from
ADD
stress
ADD
of
ADD
circumstances
ADD
to
ADD
seek
ADD
themselves
ADD
a
ADD
new
ADD
country.
ADD
There
ADD
rose
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
clear
ADD
air
ADD
a
ADD
confused
ADD
clattering
ADD
and
ADD
rumbling
ADD
from
ADD
this
ADD
great
ADD
mass
ADD
of
ADD
humanity,
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
creaking
ADD
of
ADD
wheels
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
neighing
ADD
of
ADD
horses.
ADD
Loud
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
was,
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
sufficient
ADD
to
ADD
rouse
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
tired
ADD
wayfarers
ADD
above
ADD
them.
ADD

ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
head
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
column
ADD
there
ADD
rode
ADD
a
ADD
score
ADD
or
ADD
more
ADD
of
ADD
grave
ADD
ironfaced
ADD
men,
ADD
clad
ADD
in
ADD
sombre
ADD
homespun
ADD
garments
ADD
and
ADD
armed
ADD
with
ADD
rifles.
ADD
On
ADD
reaching
ADD
the
ADD
base
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
bluff
ADD
they
ADD
halted,
ADD
and
ADD
held
ADD
a
ADD
short
ADD
council
ADD
among
ADD
themselves.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
wells
ADD
are
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
right,
ADD
my
ADD
brothers,”
ADD
said
ADD
one,
ADD
a
ADD
hard-lipped,
ADD
clean-shaven
ADD
man
ADD
with
ADD
grizzly
ADD
hair.
ADD

ADD
“To
ADD
the
ADD
right
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Sierra
ADD
Blanco—so
ADD
we
ADD
shall
ADD
reach
ADD
the
ADD
Rio
ADD
Grande,”
ADD
said
ADD
another.
ADD

ADD
“Fear
ADD
not
ADD
for
ADD
water,”
ADD
cried
ADD
a
ADD
third.
ADD
“He
ADD
who
ADD
could
ADD
draw
ADD
it
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
rocks
ADD
will
ADD
not
ADD
now
ADD
abandon
ADD
His
ADD
own
ADD
chosen
ADD
people.”
ADD

ADD
“Amen!
ADD
Amen!”
ADD
responded
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
party.
ADD

ADD
They
ADD
were
ADD
about
ADD
to
ADD
resume
ADD
their
ADD
journey
ADD
when
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
youngest
ADD
and
ADD
keenest-eyed
ADD
uttered
ADD
an
ADD
exclamation
ADD
and
ADD
pointed
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
rugged
ADD
crag
ADD
above
ADD
them.
ADD
From
ADD
its
ADD
summit
ADD
there
ADD
fluttered
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
wisp
ADD
of
ADD
pink,
ADD
showing
ADD
up
ADD
hard
ADD
and
ADD
bright
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
grey
ADD
rocks
ADD
behind.
ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
sight
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
general
ADD
reining
ADD
up
ADD
of
ADD
horses
ADD
and
ADD
unslinging
ADD
of
ADD
guns,
ADD
while
ADD
fresh
ADD
horsemen
ADD
came
ADD
galloping
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
reinforce
ADD
the
ADD
vanguard.
ADD
The
ADD
word
ADD
‘Redskins’
ADD
was
ADD
on
ADD
every
ADD
lip.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
can’t
ADD
be
ADD
any
ADD
number
ADD
of
ADD
Injuns
ADD
here,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
elderly
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
in
ADD
command.
ADD
“We
ADD
have
ADD
passed
ADD
the
ADD
Pawnees,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
are
ADD
no
ADD
other
ADD
tribes
ADD
until
ADD
we
ADD
cross
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
mountains.”
ADD

ADD
“Shall
ADD
I
ADD
go
ADD
forward
ADD
and
ADD
see,
ADD
Brother
ADD
Stangerson,”
ADD
asked
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
band.
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
I,”
ADD
“and
ADD
I,”
ADD
cried
ADD
a
ADD
dozen
ADD
voices.
ADD

ADD
“Leave
ADD
your
ADD
horses
ADD
below
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
will
ADD
await
ADD
you
ADD
here,”
ADD
the
ADD
Elder
ADD
answered.
ADD
In
ADD
a
ADD
moment
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
fellows
ADD
had
ADD
dismounted,
ADD
fastened
ADD
their
ADD
horses,
ADD
and
ADD
were
ADD
ascending
ADD
the
ADD
precipitous
ADD
slope
ADD
which
ADD
led
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
object
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
excited
ADD
their
ADD
curiosity.
ADD
They
ADD
advanced
ADD
rapidly
ADD
and
ADD
noiselessly,
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
confidence
ADD
and
ADD
dexterity
ADD
of
ADD
practised
ADD
scouts.
ADD
The
ADD
watchers
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
plain
ADD
below
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
them
ADD
flit
ADD
from
ADD
rock
ADD
to
ADD
rock
ADD
until
ADD
their
ADD
figures
ADD
stood
ADD
out
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
skyline.
ADD
The
ADD
young
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
first
ADD
given
ADD
the
ADD
alarm
ADD
was
ADD
leading
ADD
them.
ADD
Suddenly
ADD
his
ADD
followers
ADD
saw
ADD
him
ADD
throw
ADD
up
ADD
his
ADD
hands,
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
overcome
ADD
with
ADD
astonishment,
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
joining
ADD
him
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
affected
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
way
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
sight
ADD
which
ADD
met
ADD
their
ADD
eyes.
ADD

ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
plateau
ADD
which
ADD
crowned
ADD
the
ADD
barren
ADD
hill
ADD
there
ADD
stood
ADD
a
ADD
single
ADD
giant
ADD
boulder,
ADD
and
ADD
against
ADD
this
ADD
boulder
ADD
there
ADD
lay
ADD
a
ADD
tall
ADD
man,
ADD
long-bearded
ADD
and
ADD
hard-featured,
ADD
but
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
excessive
ADD
thinness.
ADD
His
ADD
placid
ADD
face
ADD
and
ADD
regular
ADD
breathing
ADD
showed
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
fast
ADD
asleep.
ADD
Beside
ADD
him
ADD
lay
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
child,
ADD
with
ADD
her
ADD
round
ADD
white
ADD
arms
ADD
encircling
ADD
his
ADD
brown
ADD
sinewy
ADD
neck,
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
golden
ADD
haired
ADD
head
ADD
resting
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
breast
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
velveteen
ADD
tunic.
ADD
Her
ADD
rosy
ADD
lips
ADD
were
ADD
parted,
ADD
showing
ADD
the
ADD
regular
ADD
line
ADD
of
ADD
snow-white
ADD
teeth
ADD
within,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
playful
ADD
smile
ADD
played
ADD
over
ADD
her
ADD
infantile
ADD
features.
ADD
Her
ADD
plump
ADD
little
ADD
white
ADD
legs
ADD
terminating
ADD
in
ADD
white
ADD
socks
ADD
and
ADD
neat
ADD
shoes
ADD
with
ADD
shining
ADD
buckles,
ADD
offered
ADD
a
ADD
strange
ADD
contrast
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
long
ADD
shrivelled
ADD
members
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
companion.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
ledge
ADD
of
ADD
rock
ADD
above
ADD
this
ADD
strange
ADD
couple
ADD
there
ADD
stood
ADD
three
ADD
solemn
ADD
buzzards,
ADD
who,
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
new
ADD
comers
ADD
uttered
ADD
raucous
ADD
screams
ADD
of
ADD
disappointment
ADD
and
ADD
flapped
ADD
sullenly
ADD
away.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
cries
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
foul
ADD
birds
ADD
awoke
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
sleepers
ADD
who
ADD
stared
ADD
about
ADD
20
ADD
them
ADD
in
ADD
bewilderment.
ADD
The
ADD
man
ADD
staggered
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
feet
ADD
and
ADD
looked
ADD
down
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
plain
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
so
ADD
desolate
ADD
when
ADD
sleep
ADD
had
ADD
overtaken
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
now
ADD
traversed
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
enormous
ADD
body
ADD
of
ADD
men
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
beasts.
ADD
His
ADD
face
ADD
assumed
ADD
an
ADD
expression
ADD
of
ADD
incredulity
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
gazed,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
passed
ADD
his
ADD
boney
ADD
hand
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
eyes.
ADD
“This
ADD
is
ADD
what
ADD
they
ADD
call
ADD
delirium,
ADD
I
ADD
guess,”
ADD
he
ADD
muttered.
ADD
The
ADD
child
ADD
stood
ADD
beside
ADD
him,
ADD
holding
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
skirt
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
coat,
ADD
and
ADD
said
ADD
nothing
ADD
but
ADD
looked
ADD
all
ADD
round
ADD
her
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
wondering
ADD
questioning
ADD
gaze
ADD
of
ADD
childhood.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
rescuing
ADD
party
ADD
were
ADD
speedily
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
convince
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
castaways
ADD
that
ADD
their
ADD
appearance
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
delusion.
ADD
One
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
seized
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
girl,
ADD
and
ADD
hoisted
ADD
her
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
shoulder,
ADD
while
ADD
two
ADD
others
ADD
supported
ADD
her
ADD
gaunt
ADD
companion,
ADD
and
ADD
assisted
ADD
him
ADD
towards
ADD
the
ADD
waggons.
ADD

ADD
“My
ADD
name
ADD
is
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier,”
ADD
the
ADD
wanderer
ADD
explained;
ADD
“me
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
little
ADD
un
ADD
are
ADD
all
ADD
that’s
ADD
left
ADD
o’
ADD
twenty-one
ADD
people.
ADD
The
ADD
rest
ADD
is
ADD
all
ADD
dead
ADD
o’
ADD
thirst
ADD
and
ADD
hunger
ADD
away
ADD
down
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
south.”
ADD

ADD
“Is
ADD
she
ADD
your
ADD
child?”
ADD
asked
ADD
someone.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
guess
ADD
she
ADD
is
ADD
now,”
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
cried,
ADD
defiantly;
ADD
“she’s
ADD
mine
ADD
‘cause
ADD
I
ADD
saved
ADD
her.
ADD
No
ADD
man
ADD
will
ADD
take
ADD
her
ADD
from
ADD
me.
ADD
She’s
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
from
ADD
this
ADD
day
ADD
on.
ADD
Who
ADD
are
ADD
you,
ADD
though?”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
glancing
ADD
with
ADD
curiosity
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
stalwart,
ADD
sunburned
ADD
rescuers;
ADD
“there
ADD
seems
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
powerful
ADD
lot
ADD
of
ADD
ye.”
ADD

ADD
“Nigh
ADD
upon
ADD
ten
ADD
thousand,”
ADD
said
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
men;
ADD
“we
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
persecuted
ADD
children
ADD
of
ADD
God—the
ADD
chosen
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Angel
ADD
Merona.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
never
ADD
heard
ADD
tell
ADD
on
ADD
him,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
wanderer.
ADD
“He
ADD
appears
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
chosen
ADD
a
ADD
fair
ADD
crowd
ADD
of
ADD
ye.”
ADD

ADD
“Do
ADD
not
ADD
jest
ADD
at
ADD
that
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
sacred,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
sternly.
ADD
“We
ADD
are
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
who
ADD
believe
ADD
in
ADD
those
ADD
sacred
ADD
writings,
ADD
drawn
ADD
in
ADD
Egyptian
ADD
letters
ADD
on
ADD
plates
ADD
of
ADD
beaten
ADD
gold,
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
handed
ADD
unto
ADD
the
ADD
holy
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Smith
ADD
at
ADD
Palmyra.
ADD
We
ADD
have
ADD
come
ADD
from
ADD
Nauvoo,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
State
ADD
of
ADD
Illinois,
ADD
where
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
founded
ADD
our
ADD
temple.
ADD
We
ADD
have
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
seek
ADD
a
ADD
refuge
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
violent
ADD
man
ADD
and
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
godless,
ADD
even
ADD
though
ADD
it
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
heart
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
desert.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
Nauvoo
ADD
evidently
ADD
recalled
ADD
recollections
ADD
to
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier.
ADD
“I
ADD
see,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“you
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
Mormons.”
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
Mormons,”
ADD
answered
ADD
his
ADD
companions
ADD
with
ADD
one
ADD
voice.
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
where
ADD
are
ADD
you
ADD
going?”
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
know.
ADD
The
ADD
hand
ADD
of
ADD
God
ADD
is
ADD
leading
ADD
us
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
person
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
Prophet.
ADD
You
ADD
must
ADD
come
ADD
before
ADD
him.
ADD
He
ADD
shall
ADD
say
ADD
what
ADD
is
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
done
ADD
with
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
They
ADD
had
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
base
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
hill
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
time,
ADD
and
ADD
were
ADD
surrounded
ADD
by
ADD
crowds
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
pilgrims—pale-faced
ADD
meek-looking
ADD
women,
ADD
strong
ADD
laughing
ADD
children,
ADD
and
ADD
anxious
ADD
earnest-eyed
ADD
men.
ADD
Many
ADD
were
ADD
the
ADD
cries
ADD
of
ADD
astonishment
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
commiseration
ADD
which
ADD
arose
ADD
from
ADD
them
ADD
when
ADD
they
ADD
perceived
ADD
the
ADD
youth
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
strangers
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
destitution
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
other.
ADD
Their
ADD
escort
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
halt,
ADD
however,
ADD
but
ADD
pushed
ADD
on,
ADD
followed
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
crowd
ADD
of
ADD
Mormons,
ADD
until
ADD
they
ADD
reached
ADD
a
ADD
waggon,
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
conspicuous
ADD
for
ADD
its
ADD
great
ADD
size
ADD
and
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
gaudiness
ADD
and
ADD
smartness
ADD
of
ADD
its
ADD
appearance.
ADD
Six
ADD
horses
ADD
were
ADD
yoked
ADD
to
ADD
it,
ADD
whereas
ADD
the
ADD
others
ADD
were
ADD
furnished
ADD
with
ADD
two,
ADD
or,
ADD
at
ADD
most,
ADD
four
ADD
a-piece.
ADD
Beside
ADD
the
ADD
driver
ADD
there
ADD
sat
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
thirty
ADD
years
ADD
of
ADD
age,
ADD
but
ADD
whose
ADD
massive
ADD
head
ADD
and
ADD
resolute
ADD
expression
ADD
marked
ADD
him
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
leader.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
reading
ADD
a
ADD
brown-backed
ADD
volume,
ADD
but
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
crowd
ADD
approached
ADD
he
ADD
laid
ADD
it
ADD
aside,
ADD
and
ADD
listened
ADD
attentively
ADD
to
ADD
an
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
episode.
ADD
Then
ADD
he
ADD
turned
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
castaways.
ADD

ADD
“If
ADD
we
ADD
take
ADD
you
ADD
with
ADD
us,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
in
ADD
solemn
ADD
words,
ADD
“it
ADD
can
ADD
only
ADD
be
ADD
as
ADD
believers
ADD
in
ADD
our
ADD
own
ADD
creed.
ADD
We
ADD
shall
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
wolves
ADD
in
ADD
our
ADD
fold.
ADD
Better
ADD
far
ADD
that
ADD
your
ADD
bones
ADD
should
ADD
bleach
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
wilderness
ADD
than
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
should
ADD
prove
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
that
ADD
little
ADD
speck
ADD
of
ADD
decay
ADD
which
ADD
in
ADD
time
ADD
corrupts
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
fruit.
ADD
Will
ADD
you
ADD
come
ADD
with
ADD
us
ADD
on
ADD
these
ADD
terms?”
ADD

ADD
“Guess
ADD
I’ll
ADD
come
ADD
with
ADD
you
ADD
on
ADD
any
ADD
terms,”
ADD
said
ADD
Ferrier,
ADD
with
ADD
such
ADD
emphasis
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
grave
ADD
Elders
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
restrain
ADD
a
ADD
smile.
ADD
The
ADD
leader
ADD
alone
ADD
retained
ADD
his
ADD
stern,
ADD
impressive
ADD
expression.
ADD

ADD
“Take
ADD
him,
ADD
Brother
ADD
Stangerson,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“give
ADD
him
ADD
food
ADD
and
ADD
drink,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
child
ADD
likewise.
ADD
Let
ADD
it
ADD
be
ADD
your
ADD
task
ADD
also
ADD
to
ADD
teach
ADD
him
ADD
our
ADD
holy
ADD
creed.
ADD
We
ADD
have
ADD
delayed
ADD
long
ADD
enough.
ADD
Forward!
ADD
On,
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
Zion!”
ADD

ADD
“On,
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
Zion!”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
crowd
ADD
of
ADD
Mormons,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
words
ADD
rippled
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
long
ADD
caravan,
ADD
passing
ADD
from
ADD
mouth
ADD
to
ADD
mouth
ADD
until
ADD
they
ADD
died
ADD
away
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
dull
ADD
murmur
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
far
ADD
distance.
ADD
With
ADD
a
ADD
cracking
ADD
of
ADD
whips
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
creaking
ADD
of
ADD
wheels
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
waggons
ADD
got
ADD
into
ADD
motion,
ADD
and
ADD
soon
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
caravan
ADD
was
ADD
winding
ADD
along
ADD
once
ADD
more.
ADD
The
ADD
Elder
ADD
to
ADD
whose
ADD
care
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
waifs
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
committed,
ADD
led
ADD
them
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
waggon,
ADD
where
ADD
a
ADD
meal
ADD
was
ADD
already
ADD
awaiting
ADD
them.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
shall
ADD
remain
ADD
here,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“In
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
days
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
have
ADD
recovered
ADD
from
ADD
your
ADD
fatigues.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
meantime,
ADD
remember
ADD
that
ADD
now
ADD
and
ADD
for
ADD
ever
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
religion.
ADD
Brigham
ADD
Young
ADD
has
ADD
said
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
has
ADD
spoken
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
voice
ADD
of
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Smith,
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
voice
ADD
of
ADD
God.”

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
II.
ADD
THE
ADD
FLOWER
ADD
OF
ADD
UTAH.
ADD

ADD
THIS
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
the
ADD
place
ADD
to
ADD
commemorate
ADD
the
ADD
trials
ADD
and
ADD
privations
ADD
endured
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
immigrant
ADD
Mormons
ADD
before
ADD
they
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
final
ADD
haven.
ADD
From
ADD
the
ADD
shores
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Mississippi
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
western
ADD
slopes
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Rocky
ADD
Mountains
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
struggled
ADD
on
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
constancy
ADD
almost
ADD
unparalleled
ADD
in
ADD
history.
ADD
The
ADD
savage
ADD
man,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
savage
ADD
beast,
ADD
hunger,
ADD
thirst,
ADD
fatigue,
ADD
and
ADD
disease—every
ADD
impediment
ADD
which
ADD
Nature
ADD
could
ADD
place
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
way,
ADD
had
ADD
all
ADD
been
ADD
overcome
ADD
with
ADD
Anglo-Saxon
ADD
tenacity.
ADD
Yet
ADD
the
ADD
long
ADD
journey
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
accumulated
ADD
terrors
ADD
had
ADD
shaken
ADD
the
ADD
hearts
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
stoutest
ADD
among
ADD
them.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
one
ADD
who
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
sink
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
knees
ADD
in
ADD
heartfelt
ADD
prayer
ADD
when
ADD
they
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
broad
ADD
valley
ADD
of
ADD
Utah
ADD
bathed
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
sunlight
ADD
beneath
ADD
them,
ADD
and
ADD
learned
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
lips
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
leader
ADD
that
ADD
this
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
promised
ADD
land,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
these
ADD
virgin
ADD
acres
ADD
were
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
theirs
ADD
for
ADD
evermore.
ADD

ADD
Young
ADD
speedily
ADD
proved
ADD
himself
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
skilful
ADD
administrator
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
resolute
ADD
chief.
ADD
Maps
ADD
were
ADD
drawn
ADD
and
ADD
charts
ADD
prepared,
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
future
ADD
city
ADD
was
ADD
sketched
ADD
out.
ADD
All
ADD
around
ADD
farms
ADD
were
ADD
apportioned
ADD
and
ADD
allotted
ADD
in
ADD
proportion
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
standing
ADD
of
ADD
each
ADD
individual.
ADD
The
ADD
tradesman
ADD
was
ADD
put
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
trade
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
artisan
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
calling.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
town
ADD
streets
ADD
and
ADD
squares
ADD
sprang
ADD
up,
ADD
as
ADD
if
ADD
by
ADD
magic.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
country
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
draining
ADD
and
ADD
hedging,
ADD
planting
ADD
and
ADD
clearing,
ADD
until
ADD
the
ADD
next
ADD
summer
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
country
ADD
golden
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
wheat
ADD
crop.
ADD
Everything
ADD
prospered
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
strange
ADD
settlement.
ADD
Above
ADD
all,
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
temple
ADD
which
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
erected
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
centre
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
city
ADD
grew
ADD
ever
ADD
taller
ADD
and
ADD
larger.
ADD
From
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
blush
ADD
of
ADD
dawn
ADD
until
ADD
the
ADD
closing
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
twilight,
ADD
the
ADD
clatter
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
hammer
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
rasp
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
saw
ADD
was
ADD
never
ADD
absent
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
monument
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
immigrants
ADD
erected
ADD
to
ADD
Him
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
led
ADD
them
ADD
safe
ADD
through
ADD
many
ADD
dangers.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
two
ADD
castaways,
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
girl
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
shared
ADD
his
ADD
fortunes
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
adopted
ADD
as
ADD
his
ADD
daughter,
ADD
accompanied
ADD
the
ADD
Mormons
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
great
ADD
pilgrimage.
ADD
Little
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
was
ADD
borne
ADD
along
ADD
pleasantly
ADD
enough
ADD
in
ADD
Elder
ADD
Stangerson’s
ADD
waggon,
ADD
a
ADD
retreat
ADD
which
ADD
she
ADD
shared
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon’s
ADD
three
ADD
wives
ADD
and
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
son,
ADD
a
ADD
headstrong
ADD
forward
ADD
boy
ADD
of
ADD
twelve.
ADD
Having
ADD
rallied,
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
elasticity
ADD
of
ADD
childhood,
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
shock
ADD
caused
ADD
by
ADD
her
ADD
mother’s
ADD
death,
ADD
she
ADD
soon
ADD
became
ADD
a
ADD
pet
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
women,
ADD
and
ADD
reconciled
ADD
herself
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
new
ADD
life
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
moving
ADD
canvas-covered
ADD
home.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
meantime
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
having
ADD
recovered
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
privations,
ADD
distinguished
ADD
himself
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
useful
ADD
guide
ADD
and
ADD
an
ADD
indefatigable
ADD
hunter.
ADD
So
ADD
rapidly
ADD
did
ADD
he
ADD
gain
ADD
the
ADD
esteem
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
new
ADD
companions,
ADD
that
ADD
when
ADD
they
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
wanderings,
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
unanimously
ADD
agreed
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
provided
ADD
with
ADD
as
ADD
large
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
fertile
ADD
a
ADD
tract
ADD
of
ADD
land
ADD
as
ADD
any
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
settlers,
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
exception
ADD
of
ADD
Young
ADD
himself,
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
Kemball,
ADD
Johnston,
ADD
and
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
who
ADD
were
ADD
the
ADD
four
ADD
principal
ADD
Elders.
ADD

ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
farm
ADD
thus
ADD
acquired
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
built
ADD
himself
ADD
a
ADD
substantial
ADD
log-house,
ADD
which
ADD
received
ADD
so
ADD
many
ADD
additions
ADD
in
ADD
succeeding
ADD
years
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
grew
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
roomy
ADD
villa.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
practical
ADD
turn
ADD
of
ADD
mind,
ADD
keen
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
dealings
ADD
and
ADD
skilful
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
hands.
ADD
His
ADD
iron
ADD
constitution
ADD
enabled
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
work
ADD
morning
ADD
and
ADD
evening
ADD
at
ADD
improving
ADD
and
ADD
tilling
ADD
his
ADD
lands.
ADD
Hence
ADD
it
ADD
came
ADD
about
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
farm
ADD
and
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
belonged
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
prospered
ADD
exceedingly.
ADD
In
ADD
three
ADD
years
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
better
ADD
off
ADD
than
ADD
his
ADD
neighbours,
ADD
in
ADD
six
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
well-to-do,
ADD
in
ADD
nine
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
rich,
ADD
and
ADD
in
ADD
twelve
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
not
ADD
half
ADD
a
ADD
dozen
ADD
men
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
of
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City
ADD
who
ADD
could
ADD
compare
ADD
with
ADD
him.
ADD
From
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
inland
ADD
sea
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
distant
ADD
Wahsatch
ADD
Mountains
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
name
ADD
better
ADD
known
ADD
than
ADD
that
ADD
of
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier.
ADD

ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
one
ADD
way
ADD
and
ADD
only
ADD
one
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
offended
ADD
the
ADD
susceptibilities
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
co-religionists.
ADD
No
ADD
argument
ADD
or
ADD
persuasion
ADD
could
ADD
ever
ADD
induce
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
set
ADD
up
ADD
a
ADD
female
ADD
establishment
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
manner
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
companions.
ADD
He
ADD
never
ADD
gave
ADD
reasons
ADD
for
ADD
this
ADD
persistent
ADD
refusal,
ADD
but
ADD
contented
ADD
himself
ADD
by
ADD
resolutely
ADD
and
ADD
inflexibly
ADD
adhering
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
determination.
ADD
There
ADD
were
ADD
some
ADD
who
ADD
accused
ADD
him
ADD
of
ADD
lukewarmness
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
adopted
ADD
religion,
ADD
and
ADD
others
ADD
who
ADD
put
ADD
it
ADD
down
ADD
to
ADD
greed
ADD
of
ADD
wealth
ADD
and
ADD
reluctance
ADD
to
ADD
incur
ADD
expense.
ADD
Others,
ADD
again,
ADD
spoke
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
early
ADD
love
ADD
affair,
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
fair-haired
ADD
girl
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
pined
ADD
away
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
shores
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Atlantic.
ADD
Whatever
ADD
the
ADD
reason,
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
remained
ADD
strictly
ADD
celibate.
ADD
In
ADD
every
ADD
other
ADD
respect
ADD
he
ADD
conformed
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
religion
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
settlement,
ADD
and
ADD
gained
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
being
ADD
an
ADD
orthodox
ADD
and
ADD
straight-walking
ADD
man.
ADD

ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
grew
ADD
up
ADD
within
ADD
the
ADD
log-house,
ADD
and
ADD
assisted
ADD
her
ADD
adopted
ADD
father
ADD
in
ADD
all
ADD
his
ADD
undertakings.
ADD
The
ADD
keen
ADD
air
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
balsamic
ADD
odour
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
pine
ADD
trees
ADD
took
ADD
the
ADD
place
ADD
of
ADD
nurse
ADD
and
ADD
mother
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
girl.
ADD
As
ADD
year
ADD
succeeded
ADD
to
ADD
year
ADD
she
ADD
grew
ADD
taller
ADD
and
ADD
stronger,
ADD
her
ADD
cheek
ADD
more
ADD
rudy,
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
step
ADD
more
ADD
elastic.
ADD
Many
ADD
a
ADD
wayfarer
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
high
ADD
road
ADD
which
ADD
ran
ADD
by
ADD
Ferrier’s
ADD
farm
ADD
felt
ADD
long-forgotten
ADD
thoughts
ADD
revive
ADD
in
ADD
their
ADD
mind
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
watched
ADD
her
ADD
lithe
ADD
girlish
ADD
figure
ADD
tripping
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
wheatfields,
ADD
or
ADD
met
ADD
her
ADD
mounted
ADD
upon
ADD
her
ADD
father’s
ADD
mustang,
ADD
and
ADD
managing
ADD
it
ADD
with
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
ease
ADD
and
ADD
grace
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
true
ADD
child
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
West.
ADD
So
ADD
the
ADD
bud
ADD
blossomed
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
flower,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
year
ADD
which
ADD
saw
ADD
her
ADD
father
ADD
the
ADD
richest
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
farmers
ADD
left
ADD
her
ADD
as
ADD
fair
ADD
a
ADD
specimen
ADD
of
ADD
American
ADD
girlhood
ADD
as
ADD
could
ADD
be
ADD
found
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
Pacific
ADD
slope.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
the
ADD
father,
ADD
however,
ADD
who
ADD
first
ADD
discovered
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
child
ADD
had
ADD
developed
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
woman.
ADD
It
ADD
seldom
ADD
is
ADD
in
ADD
such
ADD
cases.
ADD
That
ADD
mysterious
ADD
change
ADD
is
ADD
too
ADD
subtle
ADD
and
ADD
too
ADD
gradual
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
measured
ADD
by
ADD
dates.
ADD
Least
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
does
ADD
the
ADD
maiden
ADD
herself
ADD
know
ADD
it
ADD
until
ADD
the
ADD
tone
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
voice
ADD
or
ADD
the
ADD
touch
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
hand
ADD
sets
ADD
her
ADD
heart
ADD
thrilling
ADD
within
ADD
her,
ADD
and
ADD
she
ADD
learns,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
mixture
ADD
of
ADD
pride
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
fear,
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
new
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
larger
ADD
nature
ADD
has
ADD
awoken
ADD
within
ADD
her.
ADD
There
ADD
are
ADD
few
ADD
who
ADD
cannot
ADD
recall
ADD
that
ADD
day
ADD
and
ADD
remember
ADD
the
ADD
one
ADD
little
ADD
incident
ADD
which
ADD
heralded
ADD
the
ADD
dawn
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
new
ADD
life.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
of
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
the
ADD
occasion
ADD
was
ADD
serious
ADD
enough
ADD
in
ADD
itself,
ADD
apart
ADD
from
ADD
its
ADD
future
ADD
influence
ADD
on
ADD
her
ADD
destiny
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
of
ADD
many
ADD
besides.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
warm
ADD
June
ADD
morning,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
Latter
ADD
Day
ADD
Saints
ADD
were
ADD
as
ADD
busy
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
bees
ADD
whose
ADD
hive
ADD
they
ADD
have
ADD
chosen
ADD
for
ADD
their
ADD
emblem.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
fields
ADD
and
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
streets
ADD
rose
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
hum
ADD
of
ADD
human
ADD
industry.
ADD
Down
ADD
the
ADD
dusty
ADD
high
ADD
roads
ADD
defiled
ADD
long
ADD
streams
ADD
of
ADD
heavily-laden
ADD
mules,
ADD
all
ADD
heading
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
west,
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
gold
ADD
fever
ADD
had
ADD
broken
ADD
out
ADD
in
ADD
California,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
Overland
ADD
Route
ADD
lay
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
City
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Elect.
ADD
There,
ADD
too,
ADD
were
ADD
droves
ADD
of
ADD
sheep
ADD
and
ADD
bullocks
ADD
coming
ADD
in
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
outlying
ADD
pasture
ADD
lands,
ADD
and
ADD
trains
ADD
of
ADD
tired
ADD
immigrants,
ADD
men
ADD
and
ADD
horses
ADD
equally
ADD
weary
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
interminable
ADD
journey.
ADD
Through
ADD
all
ADD
this
ADD
motley
ADD
assemblage,
ADD
threading
ADD
her
ADD
way
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
skill
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
accomplished
ADD
rider,
ADD
there
ADD
galloped
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier,
ADD
her
ADD
fair
ADD
face
ADD
flushed
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
exercise
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
long
ADD
chestnut
ADD
hair
ADD
floating
ADD
out
ADD
behind
ADD
her.
ADD
She
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
commission
ADD
from
ADD
her
ADD
father
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
City,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
dashing
ADD
in
ADD
as
ADD
she
ADD
had
ADD
done
ADD
many
ADD
a
ADD
time
ADD
before,
ADD
with
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
fearlessness
ADD
of
ADD
youth,
ADD
thinking
ADD
only
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
task
ADD
and
ADD
how
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
performed.
ADD
The
ADD
travel-stained
ADD
adventurers
ADD
gazed
ADD
after
ADD
her
ADD
in
ADD
astonishment,
ADD
and
ADD
even
ADD
the
ADD
unemotional
ADD
Indians,
ADD
journeying
ADD
in
ADD
with
ADD
their
ADD
pelties,
ADD
relaxed
ADD
their
ADD
accustomed
ADD
stoicism
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
marvelled
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
beauty
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
pale-faced
ADD
maiden.
ADD

ADD
She
ADD
had
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
outskirts
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
city
ADD
when
ADD
she
ADD
found
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
blocked
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
drove
ADD
of
ADD
cattle,
ADD
driven
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
half-dozen
ADD
wild-looking
ADD
herdsmen
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
plains.
ADD
In
ADD
her
ADD
impatience
ADD
she
ADD
endeavoured
ADD
to
ADD
pass
ADD
this
ADD
obstacle
ADD
by
ADD
pushing
ADD
her
ADD
horse
ADD
into
ADD
what
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
gap.
ADD
Scarcely
ADD
had
ADD
she
ADD
got
ADD
fairly
ADD
into
ADD
it,
ADD
however,
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
beasts
ADD
closed
ADD
in
ADD
behind
ADD
her,
ADD
and
ADD
she
ADD
found
ADD
herself
ADD
completely
ADD
imbedded
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
moving
ADD
stream
ADD
of
ADD
fierce-eyed,
ADD
long-horned
ADD
bullocks.
ADD
Accustomed
ADD
as
ADD
she
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
deal
ADD
with
ADD
cattle,
ADD
she
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
alarmed
ADD
at
ADD
her
ADD
situation,
ADD
but
ADD
took
ADD
advantage
ADD
of
ADD
every
ADD
opportunity
ADD
to
ADD
urge
ADD
her
ADD
horse
ADD
on
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
hopes
ADD
of
ADD
pushing
ADD
her
ADD
way
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
cavalcade.
ADD
Unfortunately
ADD
the
ADD
horns
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
creatures,
ADD
either
ADD
by
ADD
accident
ADD
or
ADD
design,
ADD
came
ADD
in
ADD
violent
ADD
contact
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
flank
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mustang,
ADD
and
ADD
excited
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
madness.
ADD
In
ADD
an
ADD
instant
ADD
it
ADD
reared
ADD
up
ADD
upon
ADD
its
ADD
hind
ADD
legs
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
snort
ADD
of
ADD
rage,
ADD
and
ADD
pranced
ADD
and
ADD
tossed
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
way
ADD
that
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
unseated
ADD
any
ADD
but
ADD
a
ADD
most
ADD
skilful
ADD
rider.
ADD
The
ADD
situation
ADD
was
ADD
full
ADD
of
ADD
peril.
ADD
Every
ADD
plunge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
excited
ADD
horse
ADD
brought
ADD
it
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
horns
ADD
again,
ADD
and
ADD
goaded
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
fresh
ADD
madness.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
girl
ADD
could
ADD
do
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
herself
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
saddle,
ADD
yet
ADD
a
ADD
slip
ADD
would
ADD
mean
ADD
a
ADD
terrible
ADD
death
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
hoofs
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
unwieldy
ADD
and
ADD
terrified
ADD
animals.
ADD
Unaccustomed
ADD
to
ADD
sudden
ADD
emergencies,
ADD
her
ADD
head
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
swim,
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
grip
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
bridle
ADD
to
ADD
relax.
ADD
Choked
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
rising
ADD
cloud
ADD
of
ADD
dust
ADD
and
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
steam
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
struggling
ADD
creatures,
ADD
she
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
abandoned
ADD
her
ADD
efforts
ADD
in
ADD
despair,
ADD
but
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
kindly
ADD
voice
ADD
at
ADD
her
ADD
elbow
ADD
which
ADD
assured
ADD
her
ADD
of
ADD
assistance.
ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
moment
ADD
a
ADD
sinewy
ADD
brown
ADD
hand
ADD
caught
ADD
the
ADD
frightened
ADD
horse
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
curb,
ADD
and
ADD
forcing
ADD
a
ADD
way
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
drove,
ADD
soon
ADD
brought
ADD
her
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
outskirts.
ADD

ADD
“You’re
ADD
not
ADD
hurt,
ADD
I
ADD
hope,
ADD
miss,”
ADD
said
ADD
her
ADD
preserver,
ADD
respectfully.
ADD

ADD
She
ADD
looked
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
dark,
ADD
fierce
ADD
face,
ADD
and
ADD
laughed
ADD
saucily.
ADD
“I’m
ADD
awful
ADD
frightened,”
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
naively;
ADD
“whoever
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
thought
ADD
that
ADD
Poncho
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
so
ADD
scared
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
lot
ADD
of
ADD
cows?”
ADD

ADD
“Thank
ADD
God
ADD
you
ADD
kept
ADD
your
ADD
seat,”
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
said
ADD
earnestly.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
tall,
ADD
savage-looking
ADD
young
ADD
fellow,
ADD
mounted
ADD
on
ADD
a
ADD
powerful
ADD
roan
ADD
horse,
ADD
and
ADD
clad
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
rough
ADD
dress
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
hunter,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
rifle
ADD
slung
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
shoulders.
ADD
“I
ADD
guess
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
daughter
ADD
of
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier,”
ADD
he
ADD
remarked,
ADD
“I
ADD
saw
ADD
you
ADD
ride
ADD
down
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
house.
ADD
When
ADD
you
ADD
see
ADD
him,
ADD
ask
ADD
him
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
remembers
ADD
the
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hopes
ADD
of
ADD
St.
ADD
Louis.
ADD
If
ADD
he’s
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
Ferrier,
ADD
my
ADD
father
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
were
ADD
pretty
ADD
thick.”
ADD

ADD
“Hadn’t
ADD
you
ADD
better
ADD
come
ADD
and
ADD
ask
ADD
yourself?”
ADD
she
ADD
asked,
ADD
demurely.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
young
ADD
fellow
ADD
seemed
ADD
pleased
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
suggestion,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
dark
ADD
eyes
ADD
sparkled
ADD
with
ADD
pleasure.
ADD
“I’ll
ADD
do
ADD
so,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“we’ve
ADD
been
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
for
ADD
two
ADD
months,
ADD
and
ADD
are
ADD
not
ADD
over
ADD
and
ADD
above
ADD
in
ADD
visiting
ADD
condition.
ADD
He
ADD
must
ADD
take
ADD
us
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
finds
ADD
us.”
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
has
ADD
a
ADD
good
ADD
deal
ADD
to
ADD
thank
ADD
you
ADD
for,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
have
ADD
I,”
ADD
she
ADD
answered,
ADD
“he’s
ADD
awful
ADD
fond
ADD
of
ADD
me.
ADD
If
ADD
those
ADD
cows
ADD
had
ADD
jumped
ADD
on
ADD
me
ADD
he’d
ADD
have
ADD
never
ADD
got
ADD
over
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“Neither
ADD
would
ADD
I,”
ADD
said
ADD
her
ADD
companion.
ADD

ADD
“You!
ADD
Well,
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
see
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
would
ADD
make
ADD
much
ADD
matter
ADD
to
ADD
you,
ADD
anyhow.
ADD
You
ADD
ain’t
ADD
even
ADD
a
ADD
friend
ADD
of
ADD
ours.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
young
ADD
hunter’s
ADD
dark
ADD
face
ADD
grew
ADD
so
ADD
gloomy
ADD
over
ADD
this
ADD
remark
ADD
that
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
laughed
ADD
aloud.
ADD

ADD
“There,
ADD
I
ADD
didn’t
ADD
mean
ADD
that,”
ADD
she
ADD
said;
ADD
“of
ADD
course,
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
a
ADD
friend
ADD
now.
ADD
You
ADD
must
ADD
come
ADD
and
ADD
see
ADD
us.
ADD
Now
ADD
I
ADD
must
ADD
push
ADD
along,
ADD
or
ADD
father
ADD
won’t
ADD
trust
ADD
me
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
business
ADD
any
ADD
more.
ADD
Good-bye!”
ADD

ADD
“Good-bye,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered,
ADD
raising
ADD
his
ADD
broad
ADD
sombrero,
ADD
and
ADD
bending
ADD
over
ADD
her
ADD
little
ADD
hand.
ADD
She
ADD
wheeled
ADD
her
ADD
mustang
ADD
round,
ADD
gave
ADD
it
ADD
a
ADD
cut
ADD
with
ADD
her
ADD
riding-whip,
ADD
and
ADD
darted
ADD
away
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
broad
ADD
road
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
rolling
ADD
cloud
ADD
of
ADD
dust.
ADD

ADD
Young
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
rode
ADD
on
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
companions,
ADD
gloomy
ADD
and
ADD
taciturn.
ADD
He
ADD
and
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
Nevada
ADD
Mountains
ADD
prospecting
ADD
for
ADD
silver,
ADD
and
ADD
were
ADD
returning
ADD
to
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
hope
ADD
of
ADD
raising
ADD
capital
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
work
ADD
some
ADD
lodes
ADD
which
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
discovered.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
as
ADD
keen
ADD
as
ADD
any
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
business
ADD
until
ADD
this
ADD
sudden
ADD
incident
ADD
had
ADD
drawn
ADD
his
ADD
thoughts
ADD
into
ADD
another
ADD
channel.
ADD
The
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
fair
ADD
young
ADD
girl,
ADD
as
ADD
frank
ADD
and
ADD
wholesome
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
Sierra
ADD
breezes,
ADD
had
ADD
stirred
ADD
his
ADD
volcanic,
ADD
untamed
ADD
heart
ADD
to
ADD
its
ADD
very
ADD
depths.
ADD
When
ADD
she
ADD
had
ADD
vanished
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
sight,
ADD
he
ADD
realized
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
crisis
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
life,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
neither
ADD
silver
ADD
speculations
ADD
nor
ADD
any
ADD
other
ADD
questions
ADD
could
ADD
ever
ADD
be
ADD
of
ADD
such
ADD
importance
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
as
ADD
this
ADD
new
ADD
and
ADD
all-absorbing
ADD
one.
ADD
The
ADD
love
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
sprung
ADD
up
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
heart
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
the
ADD
sudden,
ADD
changeable
ADD
fancy
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
boy,
ADD
but
ADD
rather
ADD
the
ADD
wild,
ADD
fierce
ADD
passion
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
of
ADD
strong
ADD
will
ADD
and
ADD
imperious
ADD
temper.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
accustomed
ADD
to
ADD
succeed
ADD
in
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
undertook.
ADD
He
ADD
swore
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
heart
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
not
ADD
fail
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
if
ADD
human
ADD
effort
ADD
and
ADD
human
ADD
perseverance
ADD
could
ADD
render
ADD
him
ADD
successful.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
called
ADD
on
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
that
ADD
night,
ADD
and
ADD
many
ADD
times
ADD
again,
ADD
until
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
familiar
ADD
one
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
farm-house.
ADD
John,
ADD
cooped
ADD
up
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
valley,
ADD
and
ADD
absorbed
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
work,
ADD
had
ADD
had
ADD
little
ADD
chance
ADD
of
ADD
learning
ADD
the
ADD
news
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
outside
ADD
world
ADD
during
ADD
the
ADD
last
ADD
twelve
ADD
years.
ADD
All
ADD
this
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
was
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
style
ADD
which
ADD
interested
ADD
Lucy
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
as
ADD
her
ADD
father.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
pioneer
ADD
in
ADD
California,
ADD
and
ADD
could
ADD
narrate
ADD
many
ADD
a
ADD
strange
ADD
tale
ADD
of
ADD
fortunes
ADD
made
ADD
and
ADD
fortunes
ADD
lost
ADD
in
ADD
those
ADD
wild,
ADD
halcyon
ADD
days.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
scout
ADD
too,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
trapper,
ADD
a
ADD
silver
ADD
explorer,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
ranchman.
ADD
Wherever
ADD
stirring
ADD
adventures
ADD
were
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
had,
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
there
ADD
in
ADD
search
ADD
of
ADD
them.
ADD
He
ADD
soon
ADD
became
ADD
a
ADD
favourite
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
farmer,
ADD
who
ADD
spoke
ADD
eloquently
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
virtues.
ADD
On
ADD
such
ADD
occasions,
ADD
Lucy
ADD
was
ADD
silent,
ADD
but
ADD
her
ADD
blushing
ADD
cheek
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
bright,
ADD
happy
ADD
eyes,
ADD
showed
ADD
only
ADD
too
ADD
clearly
ADD
that
ADD
her
ADD
young
ADD
heart
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
longer
ADD
her
ADD
own.
ADD
Her
ADD
honest
ADD
father
ADD
may
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
observed
ADD
these
ADD
symptoms,
ADD
but
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
assuredly
ADD
not
ADD
thrown
ADD
away
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
won
ADD
her
ADD
affections.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
summer
ADD
evening
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
galloping
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
and
ADD
pulled
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
gate.
ADD
She
ADD
was
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
doorway,
ADD
and
ADD
came
ADD
down
ADD
to
ADD
meet
ADD
him.
ADD
He
ADD
threw
ADD
the
ADD
bridle
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
fence
ADD
and
ADD
strode
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
pathway.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
am
ADD
off,
ADD
Lucy,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
taking
ADD
her
ADD
two
ADD
hands
ADD
in
ADD
his,
ADD
and
ADD
gazing
ADD
tenderly
ADD
down
ADD
into
ADD
her
ADD
face;
ADD
“I
ADD
won’t
ADD
ask
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
come
ADD
with
ADD
me
ADD
now,
ADD
but
ADD
will
ADD
you
ADD
be
ADD
ready
ADD
to
ADD
come
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
here
ADD
again?”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
when
ADD
will
ADD
that
ADD
be?”
ADD
she
ADD
asked,
ADD
blushing
ADD
and
ADD
laughing.
ADD

ADD
“A
ADD
couple
ADD
of
ADD
months
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
outside.
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
come
ADD
and
ADD
claim
ADD
you
ADD
then,
ADD
my
ADD
darling.
ADD
There’s
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
who
ADD
can
ADD
stand
ADD
between
ADD
us.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
how
ADD
about
ADD
father?”
ADD
she
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
has
ADD
given
ADD
his
ADD
consent,
ADD
provided
ADD
we
ADD
get
ADD
these
ADD
mines
ADD
working
ADD
all
ADD
right.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
fear
ADD
on
ADD
that
ADD
head.”
ADD

ADD
“Oh,
ADD
well;
ADD
of
ADD
course,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
and
ADD
father
ADD
have
ADD
arranged
ADD
it
ADD
all,
ADD
there’s
ADD
no
ADD
more
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
said,”
ADD
she
ADD
whispered,
ADD
with
ADD
her
ADD
cheek
ADD
against
ADD
his
ADD
broad
ADD
breast.
ADD

ADD
“Thank
ADD
God!”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
hoarsely,
ADD
stooping
ADD
and
ADD
kissing
ADD
her.
ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
settled,
ADD
then.
ADD
The
ADD
longer
ADD
I
ADD
stay,
ADD
the
ADD
harder
ADD
it
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
to
ADD
go.
ADD
They
ADD
are
ADD
waiting
ADD
for
ADD
me
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
cañon.
ADD
Good-bye,
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
darling—good-bye.
ADD
In
ADD
two
ADD
months
ADD
you
ADD
shall
ADD
see
ADD
me.”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
tore
ADD
himself
ADD
from
ADD
her
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
and,
ADD
flinging
ADD
himself
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
horse,
ADD
galloped
ADD
furiously
ADD
away,
ADD
never
ADD
even
ADD
looking
ADD
round,
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
afraid
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
resolution
ADD
might
ADD
fail
ADD
him
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
took
ADD
one
ADD
glance
ADD
at
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
leaving.
ADD
She
ADD
stood
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
gate,
ADD
gazing
ADD
after
ADD
him
ADD
until
ADD
he
ADD
vanished
ADD
from
ADD
her
ADD
sight.
ADD
Then
ADD
she
ADD
walked
ADD
back
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
house,
ADD
the
ADD
happiest
ADD
girl
ADD
in
ADD
all
ADD
Utah.

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
III.
ADD
JOHN
ADD
FERRIER
ADD
TALKS
ADD
WITH
ADD
THE
ADD
PROPHET.
ADD

ADD
THREE
ADD
weeks
ADD
had
ADD
passed
ADD
since
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
comrades
ADD
had
ADD
departed
ADD
from
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City.
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier’s
ADD
heart
ADD
was
ADD
sore
ADD
within
ADD
him
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
man’s
ADD
return,
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
impending
ADD
loss
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
adopted
ADD
child.
ADD
Yet
ADD
her
ADD
bright
ADD
and
ADD
happy
ADD
face
ADD
reconciled
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
arrangement
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
any
ADD
argument
ADD
could
ADD
have
ADD
done.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
always
ADD
determined,
ADD
deep
ADD
down
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
resolute
ADD
heart,
ADD
that
ADD
nothing
ADD
would
ADD
ever
ADD
induce
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
allow
ADD
his
ADD
daughter
ADD
to
ADD
wed
ADD
a
ADD
Mormon.
ADD
Such
ADD
a
ADD
marriage
ADD
he
ADD
regarded
ADD
as
ADD
no
ADD
marriage
ADD
at
ADD
all,
ADD
but
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
shame
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
disgrace.
ADD
Whatever
ADD
he
ADD
might
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon
ADD
doctrines,
ADD
upon
ADD
that
ADD
one
ADD
point
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
inflexible.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
seal
ADD
his
ADD
mouth
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
subject,
ADD
however,
ADD
for
ADD
to
ADD
express
ADD
an
ADD
unorthodox
ADD
opinion
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
dangerous
ADD
matter
ADD
in
ADD
those
ADD
days
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Land
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Saints.
ADD

ADD
Yes,
ADD
a
ADD
dangerous
ADD
matter—so
ADD
dangerous
ADD
that
ADD
even
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
saintly
ADD
dared
ADD
only
ADD
whisper
ADD
their
ADD
religious
ADD
opinions
ADD
with
ADD
bated
ADD
breath,
ADD
lest
ADD
something
ADD
which
ADD
fell
ADD
from
ADD
their
ADD
lips
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
misconstrued,
ADD
and
ADD
bring
ADD
down
ADD
a
ADD
swift
ADD
retribution
ADD
upon
ADD
them.
ADD
The
ADD
victims
ADD
of
ADD
persecution
ADD
had
ADD
now
ADD
turned
ADD
persecutors
ADD
on
ADD
their
ADD
own
ADD
account,
ADD
and
ADD
persecutors
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
terrible
ADD
description.
ADD
Not
ADD
the
ADD
Inquisition
ADD
of
ADD
Seville,
ADD
nor
ADD
the
ADD
German
ADD
Vehm-gericht,
ADD
nor
ADD
the
ADD
Secret
ADD
Societies
ADD
of
ADD
Italy,
ADD
were
ADD
ever
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
a
ADD
more
ADD
formidable
ADD
machinery
ADD
in
ADD
motion
ADD
than
ADD
that
ADD
which
ADD
cast
ADD
a
ADD
cloud
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
State
ADD
of
ADD
Utah.
ADD

ADD
Its
ADD
invisibility,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
mystery
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
attached
ADD
to
ADD
it,
ADD
made
ADD
this
ADD
organization
ADD
doubly
ADD
terrible.
ADD
It
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
omniscient
ADD
and
ADD
omnipotent,
ADD
and
ADD
yet
ADD
was
ADD
neither
ADD
seen
ADD
nor
ADD
heard.
ADD
The
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
held
ADD
out
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
Church
ADD
vanished
ADD
away,
ADD
and
ADD
none
ADD
knew
ADD
whither
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
gone
ADD
or
ADD
what
ADD
had
ADD
befallen
ADD
him.
ADD
His
ADD
wife
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
children
ADD
awaited
ADD
him
ADD
at
ADD
home,
ADD
but
ADD
no
ADD
father
ADD
ever
ADD
returned
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
them
ADD
how
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
fared
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
hands
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
secret
ADD
judges.
ADD
A
ADD
rash
ADD
word
ADD
or
ADD
a
ADD
hasty
ADD
act
ADD
was
ADD
followed
ADD
by
ADD
annihilation,
ADD
and
ADD
yet
ADD
none
ADD
knew
ADD
what
ADD
the
ADD
nature
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
terrible
ADD
power
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
suspended
ADD
over
ADD
them.
ADD
No
ADD
wonder
ADD
that
ADD
men
ADD
went
ADD
about
ADD
in
ADD
fear
ADD
and
ADD
trembling,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
even
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
heart
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
wilderness
ADD
they
ADD
dared
ADD
not
ADD
whisper
ADD
the
ADD
doubts
ADD
which
ADD
oppressed
ADD
them.
ADD

ADD
At
ADD
first
ADD
this
ADD
vague
ADD
and
ADD
terrible
ADD
power
ADD
was
ADD
exercised
ADD
only
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
recalcitrants
ADD
who,
ADD
having
ADD
embraced
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon
ADD
faith,
ADD
wished
ADD
afterwards
ADD
to
ADD
pervert
ADD
or
ADD
to
ADD
abandon
ADD
it.
ADD
Soon,
ADD
however,
ADD
it
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
wider
ADD
range.
ADD
The
ADD
supply
ADD
of
ADD
adult
ADD
women
ADD
was
ADD
running
ADD
short,
ADD
and
ADD
polygamy
ADD
without
ADD
a
ADD
female
ADD
population
ADD
on
ADD
which
ADD
to
ADD
draw
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
barren
ADD
doctrine
ADD
indeed.
ADD
Strange
ADD
rumours
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
bandied
ADD
about—rumours
ADD
of
ADD
murdered
ADD
immigrants
ADD
and
ADD
rifled
ADD
camps
ADD
in
ADD
regions
ADD
where
ADD
Indians
ADD
had
ADD
never
ADD
been
ADD
seen.
ADD
Fresh
ADD
women
ADD
appeared
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
harems
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Elders—women
ADD
who
ADD
pined
ADD
and
ADD
wept,
ADD
and
ADD
bore
ADD
upon
ADD
their
ADD
faces
ADD
the
ADD
traces
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
unextinguishable
ADD
horror.
ADD
Belated
ADD
wanderers
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
spoke
ADD
of
ADD
gangs
ADD
of
ADD
armed
ADD
men,
ADD
masked,
ADD
stealthy,
ADD
and
ADD
noiseless,
ADD
who
ADD
flitted
ADD
by
ADD
them
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
darkness.
ADD
These
ADD
tales
ADD
and
ADD
rumours
ADD
took
ADD
substance
ADD
and
ADD
shape,
ADD
and
ADD
were
ADD
corroborated
ADD
and
ADD
re-corroborated,
ADD
until
ADD
they
ADD
resolved
ADD
themselves
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
definite
ADD
name.
ADD
To
ADD
this
ADD
day,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
lonely
ADD
ranches
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
West,
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Danite
ADD
Band,
ADD
or
ADD
the
ADD
Avenging
ADD
Angels,
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
sinister
ADD
and
ADD
an
ADD
ill-omened
ADD
one.
ADD

ADD
Fuller
ADD
knowledge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
organization
ADD
which
ADD
produced
ADD
such
ADD
terrible
ADD
results
ADD
served
ADD
to
ADD
increase
ADD
rather
ADD
than
ADD
to
ADD
lessen
ADD
the
ADD
horror
ADD
which
ADD
it
ADD
inspired
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
minds
ADD
of
ADD
men.
ADD
None
ADD
knew
ADD
who
ADD
belonged
ADD
to
ADD
this
ADD
ruthless
ADD
society.
ADD
The
ADD
names
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
participators
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
deeds
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
and
ADD
violence
ADD
done
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
name
ADD
of
ADD
religion
ADD
were
ADD
kept
ADD
profoundly
ADD
secret.
ADD
The
ADD
very
ADD
friend
ADD
to
ADD
whom
ADD
you
ADD
communicated
ADD
your
ADD
misgivings
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Prophet
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
mission,
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
those
ADD
who
ADD
would
ADD
come
ADD
forth
ADD
at
ADD
night
ADD
with
ADD
fire
ADD
and
ADD
sword
ADD
to
ADD
exact
ADD
a
ADD
terrible
ADD
reparation.
ADD
Hence
ADD
every
ADD
man
ADD
feared
ADD
his
ADD
neighbour,
ADD
and
ADD
none
ADD
spoke
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
things
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
nearest
ADD
his
ADD
heart.
ADD

ADD
One
ADD
fine
ADD
morning,
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
was
ADD
about
ADD
to
ADD
set
ADD
out
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
wheatfields,
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
heard
ADD
the
ADD
click
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
latch,
ADD
and,
ADD
looking
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
window,
ADD
saw
ADD
a
ADD
stout,
ADD
sandy-haired,
ADD
middle-aged
ADD
man
ADD
coming
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
pathway.
ADD
His
ADD
heart
ADD
leapt
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
mouth,
ADD
for
ADD
this
ADD
was
ADD
none
ADD
other
ADD
than
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
Brigham
ADD
Young
ADD
himself.
ADD
Full
ADD
of
ADD
trepidation—for
ADD
he
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
visit
ADD
boded
ADD
him
ADD
little
ADD
good—Ferrier
ADD
ran
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
to
ADD
greet
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon
ADD
chief.
ADD
The
ADD
latter,
ADD
however,
ADD
received
ADD
his
ADD
salutations
ADD
coldly,
ADD
and
ADD
followed
ADD
him
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
stern
ADD
face
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
sitting-room.
ADD

ADD
“Brother
ADD
Ferrier,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
taking
ADD
a
ADD
seat,
ADD
and
ADD
eyeing
ADD
the
ADD
farmer
ADD
keenly
ADD
from
ADD
under
ADD
his
ADD
light-coloured
ADD
eyelashes,
ADD
“the
ADD
true
ADD
believers
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
good
ADD
friends
ADD
to
ADD
you.
ADD
We
ADD
picked
ADD
you
ADD
up
ADD
when
ADD
you
ADD
were
ADD
starving
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
desert,
ADD
we
ADD
shared
ADD
our
ADD
food
ADD
with
ADD
you,
ADD
led
ADD
you
ADD
safe
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Chosen
ADD
Valley,
ADD
gave
ADD
you
ADD
a
ADD
goodly
ADD
share
ADD
of
ADD
land,
ADD
and
ADD
allowed
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
wax
ADD
rich
ADD
under
ADD
our
ADD
protection.
ADD
Is
ADD
not
ADD
this
ADD
so?”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
so,”
ADD
answered
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier.
ADD

ADD
“In
ADD
return
ADD
for
ADD
all
ADD
this
ADD
we
ADD
asked
ADD
but
ADD
one
ADD
condition:
ADD
that
ADD
was,
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
should
ADD
embrace
ADD
the
ADD
true
ADD
faith,
ADD
and
ADD
conform
ADD
in
ADD
every
ADD
way
ADD
to
ADD
its
ADD
usages.
ADD
This
ADD
you
ADD
promised
ADD
to
ADD
do,
ADD
and
ADD
this,
ADD
if
ADD
common
ADD
report
ADD
says
ADD
truly,
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
neglected.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
how
ADD
have
ADD
I
ADD
neglected
ADD
it?”
ADD
asked
ADD
Ferrier,
ADD
throwing
ADD
out
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
in
ADD
expostulation.
ADD
“Have
ADD
I
ADD
not
ADD
given
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
common
ADD
fund?
ADD
Have
ADD
I
ADD
not
ADD
attended
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
Temple?
ADD
Have
ADD
I
ADD
not——?”
ADD

ADD
“Where
ADD
are
ADD
your
ADD
wives?”
ADD
asked
ADD
Young,
ADD
looking
ADD
round
ADD
him.
ADD
“Call
ADD
them
ADD
in,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
may
ADD
greet
ADD
them.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
true
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
not
ADD
married,”
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
answered.
ADD
“But
ADD
women
ADD
were
ADD
few,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
many
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
better
ADD
claims
ADD
than
ADD
I.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
lonely
ADD
man:
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
my
ADD
daughter
ADD
to
ADD
attend
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
wants.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
daughter
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
would
ADD
speak
ADD
to
ADD
you,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
leader
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Mormons.
ADD
“She
ADD
has
ADD
grown
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
flower
ADD
of
ADD
Utah,
ADD
and
ADD
has
ADD
found
ADD
favour
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
eyes
ADD
of
ADD
many
ADD
who
ADD
are
ADD
high
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
land.”
ADD

ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
groaned
ADD
internally.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
are
ADD
stories
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
would
ADD
fain
ADD
disbelieve—stories
ADD
that
ADD
she
ADD
is
ADD
sealed
ADD
to
ADD
some
ADD
Gentile.
ADD
This
ADD
must
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
gossip
ADD
of
ADD
idle
ADD
tongues.
ADD
What
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
thirteenth
ADD
rule
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
code
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
sainted
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Smith?
ADD
‘Let
ADD
every
ADD
maiden
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
true
ADD
faith
ADD
marry
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
elect;
ADD
for
ADD
if
ADD
she
ADD
wed
ADD
a
ADD
Gentile,
ADD
she
ADD
commits
ADD
a
ADD
grievous
ADD
sin.’
ADD
This
ADD
being
ADD
so,
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
impossible
ADD
that
ADD
you,
ADD
who
ADD
profess
ADD
the
ADD
holy
ADD
creed,
ADD
should
ADD
suffer
ADD
your
ADD
daughter
ADD
to
ADD
violate
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
made
ADD
no
ADD
answer,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
played
ADD
nervously
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
riding-whip.
ADD

ADD
“Upon
ADD
this
ADD
one
ADD
point
ADD
your
ADD
whole
ADD
faith
ADD
shall
ADD
be
ADD
tested—so
ADD
it
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
decided
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Sacred
ADD
Council
ADD
of
ADD
Four.
ADD
The
ADD
girl
ADD
is
ADD
young,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
would
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
her
ADD
wed
ADD
grey
ADD
hairs,
ADD
neither
ADD
would
ADD
we
ADD
deprive
ADD
her
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
choice.
ADD
We
ADD
Elders
ADD
have
ADD
many
ADD
heifers,
ADD
29
ADD
but
ADD
our
ADD
children
ADD
must
ADD
also
ADD
be
ADD
provided.
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
has
ADD
a
ADD
son,
ADD
and
ADD
Drebber
ADD
has
ADD
a
ADD
son,
ADD
and
ADD
either
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
would
ADD
gladly
ADD
welcome
ADD
your
ADD
daughter
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
house.
ADD
Let
ADD
her
ADD
choose
ADD
between
ADD
them.
ADD
They
ADD
are
ADD
young
ADD
and
ADD
rich,
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
true
ADD
faith.
ADD
What
ADD
say
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
that?”
ADD

ADD
Ferrier
ADD
remained
ADD
silent
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
little
ADD
time
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
brows
ADD
knitted.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
will
ADD
give
ADD
us
ADD
time,”
ADD
he
ADD
said
ADD
at
ADD
last.
ADD
“My
ADD
daughter
ADD
is
ADD
very
ADD
young—she
ADD
is
ADD
scarce
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
age
ADD
to
ADD
marry.”
ADD

ADD
“She
ADD
shall
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
month
ADD
to
ADD
choose,”
ADD
said
ADD
Young,
ADD
rising
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
seat.
ADD
“At
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
time
ADD
she
ADD
shall
ADD
give
ADD
her
ADD
answer.”
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
passing
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
turned,
ADD
with
ADD
flushed
ADD
face
ADD
and
ADD
flashing
ADD
eyes.
ADD
“It
ADD
were
ADD
better
ADD
for
ADD
you,
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier,”
ADD
he
ADD
thundered,
ADD
“that
ADD
you
ADD
and
ADD
she
ADD
were
ADD
now
ADD
lying
ADD
blanched
ADD
skeletons
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
Sierra
ADD
Blanco,
ADD
than
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
should
ADD
put
ADD
your
ADD
weak
ADD
wills
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
orders
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Holy
ADD
Four!”
ADD

ADD
With
ADD
a
ADD
threatening
ADD
gesture
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
hand,
ADD
he
ADD
turned
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
heard
ADD
his
ADD
heavy
ADD
step
ADD
scrunching
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
shingly
ADD
path.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
sitting
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
elbows
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
knees,
ADD
considering
ADD
how
ADD
he
ADD
should
ADD
broach
ADD
the
ADD
matter
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
daughter
ADD
when
ADD
a
ADD
soft
ADD
hand
ADD
was
ADD
laid
ADD
upon
ADD
his,
ADD
and
ADD
looking
ADD
up,
ADD
he
ADD
saw
ADD
her
ADD
standing
ADD
beside
ADD
him.
ADD
One
ADD
glance
ADD
at
ADD
her
ADD
pale,
ADD
frightened
ADD
face
ADD
showed
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
she
ADD
had
ADD
heard
ADD
what
ADD
had
ADD
passed.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
help
ADD
it,”
ADD
she
ADD
said,
ADD
in
ADD
answer
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
look.
ADD
“His
ADD
voice
ADD
rang
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
house.
ADD
Oh,
ADD
father,
ADD
father,
ADD
what
ADD
shall
ADD
we
ADD
do?”
ADD

ADD
“Don’t
ADD
you
ADD
scare
ADD
yourself,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered,
ADD
drawing
ADD
her
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
passing
ADD
his
ADD
broad,
ADD
rough
ADD
hand
ADD
caressingly
ADD
over
ADD
her
ADD
chestnut
ADD
hair.
ADD
“We’ll
ADD
fix
ADD
it
ADD
up
ADD
somehow
ADD
or
ADD
another.
ADD
You
ADD
don’t
ADD
find
ADD
your
ADD
fancy
ADD
kind
ADD
o’
ADD
lessening
ADD
for
ADD
this
ADD
chap,
ADD
do
ADD
you?”
ADD

ADD
A
ADD
sob
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
squeeze
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
hand
ADD
was
ADD
her
ADD
only
ADD
answer.
ADD

ADD
“No;
ADD
of
ADD
course
ADD
not.
ADD
I
ADD
shouldn’t
ADD
care
ADD
to
ADD
hear
ADD
you
ADD
say
ADD
you
ADD
did.
ADD
He’s
ADD
a
ADD
likely
ADD
lad,
ADD
and
ADD
he’s
ADD
a
ADD
Christian,
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
these
ADD
folk
ADD
here,
ADD
in
ADD
spite
ADD
o’
ADD
all
ADD
their
ADD
praying
ADD
and
ADD
preaching.
ADD
There’s
ADD
a
ADD
party
ADD
starting
ADD
for
ADD
Nevada
ADD
to-morrow,
ADD
and
ADD
I’ll
ADD
manage
ADD
to
ADD
send
ADD
him
ADD
a
ADD
message
ADD
letting
ADD
him
ADD
know
ADD
the
ADD
hole
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
in.
ADD
If
ADD
I
ADD
know
ADD
anything
ADD
o’
ADD
that
ADD
young
ADD
man,
ADD
he’ll
ADD
be
ADD
back
ADD
here
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
speed
ADD
that
ADD
would
ADD
whip
ADD
electro-telegraphs.”
ADD

ADD
Lucy
ADD
laughed
ADD
through
ADD
her
ADD
tears
ADD
at
ADD
her
ADD
father’s
ADD
description.
ADD

ADD
“When
ADD
he
ADD
comes,
ADD
he
ADD
will
ADD
advise
ADD
us
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
best.
ADD
But
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
for
ADD
you
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
frightened,
ADD
dear.
ADD
One
ADD
hears—one
ADD
hears
ADD
such
ADD
dreadful
ADD
stories
ADD
about
ADD
those
ADD
who
ADD
oppose
ADD
the
ADD
Prophet:
ADD
something
ADD
terrible
ADD
always
ADD
happens
ADD
to
ADD
them.”
ADD

ADD
“But
ADD
we
ADD
haven’t
ADD
opposed
ADD
him
ADD
yet,”
ADD
her
ADD
father
ADD
answered.
ADD
“It
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
look
ADD
out
ADD
for
ADD
squalls
ADD
when
ADD
we
ADD
do.
ADD
We
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
clear
ADD
month
ADD
before
ADD
us;
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
that,
ADD
I
ADD
guess
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
best
ADD
shin
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
Utah.”
ADD

ADD
“Leave
ADD
Utah!”
ADD

ADD
“That’s
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
size
ADD
of
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“But
ADD
the
ADD
farm?”
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
will
ADD
raise
ADD
as
ADD
much
ADD
as
ADD
we
ADD
can
ADD
in
ADD
money,
ADD
and
ADD
let
ADD
the
ADD
rest
ADD
go.
ADD
To
ADD
tell
ADD
the
ADD
truth,
ADD
Lucy,
ADD
it
ADD
isn’t
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
time
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
doing
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
care
ADD
about
ADD
knuckling
ADD
under
ADD
to
ADD
any
ADD
man,
ADD
as
ADD
these
ADD
folk
ADD
do
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
darned
ADD
prophet.
ADD
I’m
ADD
a
ADD
free-born
ADD
American,
ADD
and
ADD
it’s
ADD
all
ADD
new
ADD
to
ADD
me.
ADD
Guess
ADD
I’m
ADD
too
ADD
old
ADD
to
ADD
learn.
ADD
If
ADD
he
ADD
comes
ADD
browsing
ADD
about
ADD
this
ADD
farm,
ADD
he
ADD
might
ADD
chance
ADD
to
ADD
run
ADD
up
ADD
against
ADD
a
ADD
charge
ADD
of
ADD
buckshot
ADD
travelling
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
opposite
ADD
direction.”
ADD

ADD
“But
ADD
they
ADD
won’t
ADD
let
ADD
us
ADD
leave,”
ADD
his
ADD
daughter
ADD
objected.
ADD

ADD
“Wait
ADD
till
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
comes,
ADD
and
ADD
we’ll
ADD
soon
ADD
manage
ADD
that.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
meantime,
ADD
don’t
ADD
you
ADD
fret
ADD
yourself,
ADD
my
ADD
dearie,
ADD
and
ADD
don’t
ADD
get
ADD
your
ADD
eyes
ADD
swelled
ADD
up,
ADD
else
ADD
he’ll
ADD
be
ADD
walking
ADD
into
ADD
me
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
sees
ADD
you.
ADD
There’s
ADD
nothing
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
afeared
ADD
about,
ADD
and
ADD
there’s
ADD
no
ADD
danger
ADD
at
ADD
all.”
ADD

ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
uttered
ADD
these
ADD
consoling
ADD
remarks
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
confident
ADD
tone,
ADD
but
ADD
she
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
help
ADD
observing
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
paid
ADD
unusual
ADD
care
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
fastening
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
doors
ADD
that
ADD
night,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
carefully
ADD
cleaned
ADD
and
ADD
loaded
ADD
the
ADD
rusty
ADD
old
ADD
shotgun
ADD
which
ADD
hung
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wall
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
bedroom.

ADD

ADD

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
IV.
ADD
A
ADD
FLIGHT
ADD
FOR
ADD
LIFE.
ADD

ADD
ON
ADD
the
ADD
morning
ADD
which
ADD
followed
ADD
his
ADD
interview
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon
ADD
Prophet,
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
went
ADD
in
ADD
to
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City,
ADD
and
ADD
having
ADD
found
ADD
his
ADD
acquaintance,
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
bound
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
Nevada
ADD
Mountains,
ADD
he
ADD
entrusted
ADD
him
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
message
ADD
to
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope.
ADD
In
ADD
it
ADD
he
ADD
told
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
man
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
imminent
ADD
danger
ADD
which
ADD
threatened
ADD
them,
ADD
and
ADD
how
ADD
necessary
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
should
ADD
return.
ADD
Having
ADD
done
ADD
thus
ADD
he
ADD
felt
ADD
easier
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
mind,
ADD
and
ADD
returned
ADD
home
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
lighter
ADD
heart.
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
approached
ADD
his
ADD
farm,
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
surprised
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
a
ADD
horse
ADD
hitched
ADD
to
ADD
each
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
posts
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
gate.
ADD
Still
ADD
more
ADD
surprised
ADD
was
ADD
he
ADD
on
ADD
entering
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
two
ADD
young
ADD
men
ADD
in
ADD
possession
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
sitting-room.
ADD
One,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
pale
ADD
face,
ADD
was
ADD
leaning
ADD
back
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
rocking-chair,
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
feet
ADD
cocked
ADD
up
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
stove.
ADD
The
ADD
other,
ADD
a
ADD
bull-necked
ADD
youth
ADD
with
ADD
coarse
ADD
bloated
ADD
features,
ADD
was
ADD
standing
ADD
in
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
window
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
pocket,
ADD
whistling
ADD
a
ADD
popular
ADD
hymn.
ADD
Both
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
nodded
ADD
to
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
entered,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
one
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
rocking-chair
ADD
commenced
ADD
the
ADD
conversation.
ADD

ADD
“Maybe
ADD
you
ADD
don’t
ADD
know
ADD
us,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“This
ADD
here
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
son
ADD
of
ADD
Elder
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
and
ADD
I’m
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
who
ADD
travelled
ADD
with
ADD
you
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
desert
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
Lord
ADD
stretched
ADD
out
ADD
His
ADD
hand
ADD
and
ADD
gathered
ADD
you
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
true
ADD
fold.”
ADD

ADD
“As
ADD
He
ADD
will
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
nations
ADD
in
ADD
His
ADD
own
ADD
good
ADD
time,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
nasal
ADD
voice;
ADD
“He
ADD
grindeth
ADD
slowly
ADD
but
ADD
exceeding
ADD
small.”
ADD

ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
bowed
ADD
coldly.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
guessed
ADD
who
ADD
his
ADD
visitors
ADD
were.
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
have
ADD
come,”
ADD
continued
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
“at
ADD
the
ADD
advice
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
fathers
ADD
to
ADD
solicit
ADD
the
ADD
hand
ADD
of
ADD
your
ADD
daughter
ADD
for
ADD
whichever
ADD
of
ADD
us
ADD
may
ADD
seem
ADD
good
ADD
to
ADD
you
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
her.
ADD
As
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
but
ADD
four
ADD
wives
ADD
and
ADD
Brother
ADD
Drebber
ADD
here
ADD
has
ADD
seven,
ADD
it
ADD
appears
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
my
ADD
claim
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
stronger
ADD
one.”
ADD

ADD
“Nay,
ADD
nay,
ADD
Brother
ADD
Stangerson,”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
other;
ADD
“the
ADD
question
ADD
is
ADD
not
ADD
how
ADD
many
ADD
wives
ADD
we
ADD
have,
ADD
but
ADD
how
ADD
many
ADD
we
ADD
can
ADD
keep.
ADD
My
ADD
father
ADD
has
ADD
now
ADD
given
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
mills
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
the
ADD
richer
ADD
man.”
ADD

ADD
“But
ADD
my
ADD
prospects
ADD
are
ADD
better,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
other,
ADD
warmly.
ADD
“When
ADD
the
ADD
Lord
ADD
removes
ADD
my
ADD
father,
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
have
ADD
his
ADD
tanning
ADD
yard
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
leather
ADD
factory.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
your
ADD
elder,
ADD
and
ADD
am
ADD
higher
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Church.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
maiden
ADD
to
ADD
decide,”
ADD
rejoined
ADD
young
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
smirking
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
reflection
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
glass.
ADD
“We
ADD
will
ADD
leave
ADD
it
ADD
all
ADD
to
ADD
her
ADD
decision.”
ADD

ADD
During
ADD
this
ADD
dialogue,
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
had
ADD
stood
ADD
fuming
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
doorway,
ADD
hardly
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
his
ADD
riding-whip
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
backs
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
two
ADD
visitors.
ADD

ADD
“Look
ADD
here,”
ADD
he
ADD
said
ADD
at
ADD
last,
ADD
striding
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
them,
ADD
“when
ADD
my
ADD
daughter
ADD
summons
ADD
you,
ADD
you
ADD
can
ADD
come,
ADD
but
ADD
until
ADD
then
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
want
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
your
ADD
faces
ADD
again.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
two
ADD
young
ADD
Mormons
ADD
stared
ADD
at
ADD
him
ADD
in
ADD
amazement.
ADD
In
ADD
their
ADD
eyes
ADD
this
ADD
competition
ADD
between
ADD
them
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
maiden’s
ADD
hand
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
highest
ADD
of
ADD
honours
ADD
both
ADD
to
ADD
her
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
father.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
are
ADD
two
ADD
ways
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
room,”
ADD
cried
ADD
Ferrier;
ADD
“there
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
window.
ADD
Which
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
care
ADD
to
ADD
use?”
ADD

ADD
His
ADD
brown
ADD
face
ADD
looked
ADD
so
ADD
savage,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
gaunt
ADD
hands
ADD
so
ADD
threatening,
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
visitors
ADD
sprang
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
feet
ADD
and
ADD
beat
ADD
a
ADD
hurried
ADD
retreat.
ADD
The
ADD
old
ADD
farmer
ADD
followed
ADD
them
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
door.
ADD

ADD
“Let
ADD
me
ADD
know
ADD
when
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
settled
ADD
which
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
to
ADD
be,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
sardonically.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
shall
ADD
smart
ADD
for
ADD
this!”
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
cried,
ADD
white
ADD
with
ADD
rage.
ADD
“You
ADD
have
ADD
defied
ADD
the
ADD
Prophet
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
Council
ADD
of
ADD
Four.
ADD
You
ADD
shall
ADD
rue
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
your
ADD
days.”
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
hand
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Lord
ADD
shall
ADD
be
ADD
heavy
ADD
upon
ADD
you,”
ADD
cried
ADD
young
ADD
Drebber;
ADD
“He
ADD
will
ADD
arise
ADD
and
ADD
smite
ADD
you!”
ADD

ADD
“Then
ADD
I’ll
ADD
start
ADD
the
ADD
smiting,”
ADD
exclaimed
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
furiously,
ADD
and
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
rushed
ADD
upstairs
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
gun
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
Lucy
ADD
seized
ADD
him
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
arm
ADD
and
ADD
restrained
ADD
him.
ADD
Before
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
escape
ADD
from
ADD
her,
ADD
the
ADD
clatter
ADD
of
ADD
horses’
ADD
hoofs
ADD
told
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
beyond
ADD
his
ADD
reach.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
young
ADD
canting
ADD
rascals!”
ADD
he
ADD
exclaimed,
ADD
wiping
ADD
the
ADD
perspiration
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
forehead;
ADD
“I
ADD
would
ADD
sooner
ADD
see
ADD
you
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
grave,
ADD
my
ADD
girl,
ADD
than
ADD
the
ADD
wife
ADD
of
ADD
either
ADD
of
ADD
them.”
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
so
ADD
should
ADD
I,
ADD
father,”
ADD
she
ADD
answered,
ADD
with
ADD
spirit;
ADD
“but
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
will
ADD
soon
ADD
be
ADD
here.”
ADD

ADD
“Yes.
ADD
It
ADD
will
ADD
not
ADD
be
ADD
long
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
comes.
ADD
The
ADD
sooner
ADD
the
ADD
better,
ADD
for
ADD
we
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
know
ADD
what
ADD
their
ADD
next
ADD
move
ADD
may
ADD
be.”
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was,
ADD
indeed,
ADD
high
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
someone
ADD
capable
ADD
of
ADD
giving
ADD
advice
ADD
and
ADD
help
ADD
should
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
aid
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
sturdy
ADD
old
ADD
farmer
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
adopted
ADD
daughter.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
history
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
settlement
ADD
there
ADD
had
ADD
never
ADD
been
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
case
ADD
of
ADD
rank
ADD
disobedience
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
authority
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Elders.
ADD
If
ADD
minor
ADD
errors
ADD
were
ADD
punished
ADD
so
ADD
sternly,
ADD
what
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
fate
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
arch
ADD
rebel.
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
wealth
ADD
and
ADD
position
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
of
ADD
no
ADD
avail
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
Others
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
known
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
rich
ADD
as
ADD
himself
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
spirited
ADD
away
ADD
before
ADD
now,
ADD
and
ADD
their
ADD
goods
ADD
given
ADD
over
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Church.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
brave
ADD
man,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
trembled
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
vague,
ADD
shadowy
ADD
terrors
ADD
which
ADD
hung
ADD
over
ADD
him.
ADD
Any
ADD
known
ADD
danger
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
face
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
firm
ADD
lip,
ADD
but
ADD
this
ADD
suspense
ADD
was
ADD
unnerving.
ADD
He
ADD
concealed
ADD
his
ADD
fears
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
daughter,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
affected
ADD
to
ADD
make
ADD
light
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
matter,
ADD
though
ADD
she,
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
keen
ADD
eye
ADD
of
ADD
love,
ADD
saw
ADD
plainly
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
ill
ADD
at
ADD
ease.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
expected
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
receive
ADD
some
ADD
message
ADD
or
ADD
remonstrance
ADD
from
ADD
Young
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
conduct,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
mistaken,
ADD
though
ADD
it
ADD
came
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
unlooked-for
ADD
manner.
ADD
Upon
ADD
rising
ADD
next
ADD
morning
ADD
he
ADD
found,
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
surprise,
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
square
ADD
of
ADD
paper
ADD
pinned
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
coverlet
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
bed
ADD
just
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
chest.
ADD
On
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
printed,
ADD
in
ADD
bold
ADD
straggling
ADD
letters:—
ADD

ADD
“Twenty-nine
ADD
days
ADD
are
ADD
given
ADD
you
ADD
for
ADD
amendment,
ADD
and
ADD
then——”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
dash
ADD
was
ADD
more
ADD
fear-inspiring
ADD
than
ADD
any
ADD
threat
ADD
could
ADD
have
ADD
been.
ADD
How
ADD
this
ADD
warning
ADD
came
ADD
into
ADD
his
ADD
room
ADD
puzzled
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
sorely,
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
servants
ADD
slept
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
outhouse,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
doors
ADD
and
ADD
windows
ADD
had
ADD
all
ADD
been
ADD
secured.
ADD
He
ADD
crumpled
ADD
the
ADD
paper
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
said
ADD
nothing
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
daughter,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
incident
ADD
struck
ADD
a
ADD
chill
ADD
into
ADD
his
ADD
heart.
ADD
The
ADD
twenty-nine
ADD
days
ADD
were
ADD
evidently
ADD
the
ADD
balance
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
month
ADD
which
ADD
Young
ADD
had
ADD
promised.
ADD
What
ADD
strength
ADD
or
ADD
courage
ADD
could
ADD
avail
ADD
against
ADD
an
ADD
enemy
ADD
armed
ADD
with
ADD
such
ADD
mysterious
ADD
powers?
ADD
The
ADD
hand
ADD
which
ADD
fastened
ADD
that
ADD
pin
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
struck
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
heart,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
never
ADD
have
ADD
known
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
slain
ADD
him.
ADD

ADD
Still
ADD
more
ADD
shaken
ADD
was
ADD
he
ADD
next
ADD
morning.
ADD
They
ADD
had
ADD
sat
ADD
down
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
breakfast
ADD
when
ADD
Lucy
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
cry
ADD
of
ADD
surprise
ADD
pointed
ADD
upwards.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
centre
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
ceiling
ADD
was
ADD
scrawled,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
burned
ADD
stick
ADD
apparently,
ADD
the
ADD
number
ADD
28.
ADD
To
ADD
his
ADD
daughter
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
unintelligible,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
enlighten
ADD
her.
ADD
That
ADD
night
ADD
he
ADD
sat
ADD
up
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
gun
ADD
and
ADD
kept
ADD
watch
ADD
and
ADD
ward.
ADD
He
ADD
saw
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
heard
ADD
nothing,
ADD
and
ADD
yet
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
morning
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
27
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
painted
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
outside
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
door.
ADD

ADD
Thus
ADD
day
ADD
followed
ADD
day;
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
sure
ADD
as
ADD
morning
ADD
came
ADD
he
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
unseen
ADD
enemies
ADD
had
ADD
kept
ADD
their
ADD
register,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
marked
ADD
up
ADD
in
ADD
some
ADD
conspicuous
ADD
position
ADD
how
ADD
many
ADD
days
ADD
were
ADD
still
ADD
left
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
month
ADD
of
ADD
grace.
ADD
Sometimes
ADD
the
ADD
fatal
ADD
numbers
ADD
appeared
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
walls,
ADD
sometimes
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
floors,
ADD
occasionally
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
on
ADD
small
ADD
placards
ADD
stuck
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
garden
ADD
gate
ADD
or
ADD
the
ADD
railings.
ADD
With
ADD
all
ADD
his
ADD
vigilance
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
discover
ADD
whence
ADD
these
ADD
daily
ADD
warnings
ADD
proceeded.
ADD
A
ADD
horror
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
almost
ADD
superstitious
ADD
came
ADD
upon
ADD
him
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
them.
ADD
He
ADD
became
ADD
haggard
ADD
and
ADD
restless,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
troubled
ADD
look
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
hunted
ADD
creature.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
but
ADD
one
ADD
hope
ADD
in
ADD
life
ADD
now,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
arrival
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
hunter
ADD
from
ADD
Nevada.
ADD

ADD
Twenty
ADD
had
ADD
changed
ADD
to
ADD
fifteen
ADD
and
ADD
fifteen
ADD
to
ADD
ten,
ADD
but
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
news
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
absentee.
ADD
One
ADD
by
ADD
one
ADD
the
ADD
numbers
ADD
dwindled
ADD
down,
ADD
and
ADD
still
ADD
there
ADD
came
ADD
no
ADD
sign
ADD
of
ADD
him.
ADD
Whenever
ADD
a
ADD
horseman
ADD
clattered
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
road,
ADD
or
ADD
a
ADD
driver
ADD
shouted
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
team,
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
farmer
ADD
hurried
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
gate
ADD
thinking
ADD
that
ADD
help
ADD
had
ADD
arrived
ADD
at
ADD
last.
ADD
At
ADD
last,
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
saw
ADD
five
ADD
give
ADD
way
ADD
to
ADD
four
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
again
ADD
to
ADD
three,
ADD
he
ADD
lost
ADD
heart,
ADD
and
ADD
abandoned
ADD
all
ADD
hope
ADD
of
ADD
escape.
ADD
Single-handed,
ADD
and
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
limited
ADD
knowledge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
which
ADD
surrounded
ADD
the
ADD
settlement,
ADD
he
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
powerless.
ADD
The
ADD
more-frequented
ADD
roads
ADD
were
ADD
strictly
ADD
watched
ADD
and
ADD
guarded,
ADD
and
ADD
none
ADD
could
ADD
pass
ADD
along
ADD
them
ADD
without
ADD
an
ADD
order
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
Council.
ADD
Turn
ADD
which
ADD
way
ADD
he
ADD
would,
ADD
there
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
no
ADD
avoiding
ADD
the
ADD
blow
ADD
which
ADD
hung
ADD
over
ADD
him.
ADD
Yet
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
man
ADD
never
ADD
wavered
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
resolution
ADD
to
ADD
part
ADD
with
ADD
life
ADD
itself
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
consented
ADD
to
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
regarded
ADD
as
ADD
his
ADD
daughter’s
ADD
dishonour.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
sitting
ADD
alone
ADD
one
ADD
evening
ADD
pondering
ADD
deeply
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
troubles,
ADD
and
ADD
searching
ADD
vainly
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
way
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
them.
ADD
That
ADD
morning
ADD
had
ADD
shown
ADD
the
ADD
figure
ADD
2
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wall
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
house,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
next
ADD
day
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
last
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
allotted
ADD
time.
ADD
What
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
happen
ADD
then?
ADD
All
ADD
manner
ADD
of
ADD
vague
ADD
and
ADD
terrible
ADD
fancies
ADD
filled
ADD
his
ADD
imagination.
ADD
And
ADD
his
ADD
daughter—what
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
become
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
after
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
gone?
ADD
Was
ADD
there
ADD
no
ADD
escape
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
invisible
ADD
network
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
drawn
ADD
all
ADD
round
ADD
them.
ADD
He
ADD
sank
ADD
his
ADD
head
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
table
ADD
and
ADD
sobbed
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
impotence.
ADD

ADD
What
ADD
was
ADD
that?
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
silence
ADD
he
ADD
heard
ADD
a
ADD
gentle
ADD
scratching
ADD
sound—low,
ADD
but
ADD
very
ADD
distinct
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
quiet
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
night.
ADD
It
ADD
came
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
house.
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
crept
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
hall
ADD
and
ADD
listened
ADD
intently.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
pause
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
moments,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
the
ADD
low
ADD
insidious
ADD
sound
ADD
was
ADD
repeated.
ADD
Someone
ADD
was
ADD
evidently
ADD
tapping
ADD
very
ADD
gently
ADD
upon
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
panels
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
door.
ADD
Was
ADD
it
ADD
some
ADD
midnight
ADD
assassin
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
carry
ADD
out
ADD
the
ADD
murderous
ADD
orders
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
secret
ADD
tribunal?
ADD
Or
ADD
was
ADD
it
ADD
some
ADD
agent
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
marking
ADD
up
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
last
ADD
day
ADD
of
ADD
grace
ADD
had
ADD
arrived.
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
felt
ADD
that
ADD
instant
ADD
death
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
better
ADD
than
ADD
the
ADD
suspense
ADD
which
ADD
shook
ADD
his
ADD
nerves
ADD
and
ADD
chilled
ADD
his
ADD
heart.
ADD
Springing
ADD
forward
ADD
he
ADD
drew
ADD
the
ADD
bolt
ADD
and
ADD
threw
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
open.
ADD

ADD
Outside
ADD
all
ADD
was
ADD
calm
ADD
and
ADD
quiet.
ADD
The
ADD
night
ADD
was
ADD
fine,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
stars
ADD
were
ADD
twinkling
ADD
brightly
ADD
overhead.
ADD
The
ADD
little
ADD
front
ADD
garden
ADD
lay
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
farmer’s
ADD
eyes
ADD
bounded
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
fence
ADD
and
ADD
gate,
ADD
but
ADD
neither
ADD
there
ADD
nor
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
was
ADD
any
ADD
human
ADD
being
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
seen.
ADD
With
ADD
a
ADD
sigh
ADD
of
ADD
relief,
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
looked
ADD
to
ADD
right
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
left,
ADD
until
ADD
happening
ADD
to
ADD
glance
ADD
straight
ADD
down
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
feet
ADD
he
ADD
saw
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
astonishment
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
lying
ADD
flat
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
ground,
ADD
with
ADD
arms
ADD
and
ADD
legs
ADD
all
ADD
asprawl.
ADD

ADD
So
ADD
unnerved
ADD
was
ADD
he
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
sight
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
leaned
ADD
up
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
wall
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
hand
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
throat
ADD
to
ADD
stifle
ADD
his
ADD
inclination
ADD
to
ADD
call
ADD
out.
ADD
His
ADD
first
ADD
thought
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
prostrate
ADD
figure
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
wounded
ADD
or
ADD
dying
ADD
man,
ADD
but
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
watched
ADD
it
ADD
he
ADD
saw
ADD
it
ADD
writhe
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
ground
ADD
and
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
hall
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
rapidity
ADD
and
ADD
noiselessness
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
serpent.
ADD
Once
ADD
within
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
sprang
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
feet,
ADD
closed
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
revealed
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
astonished
ADD
farmer
ADD
the
ADD
fierce
ADD
face
ADD
and
ADD
resolute
ADD
expression
ADD
of
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope.
ADD

ADD
“Good
ADD
God!”
ADD
gasped
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier.
ADD
“How
ADD
you
ADD
scared
ADD
me!
ADD
Whatever
ADD
made
ADD
you
ADD
come
ADD
in
ADD
like
ADD
that.”
ADD

ADD
“Give
ADD
me
ADD
food,”
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
said,
ADD
hoarsely.
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
time
ADD
for
ADD
bite
ADD
or
ADD
sup
ADD
for
ADD
eight-and-forty
ADD
hours.”
ADD
He
ADD
flung
ADD
himself
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
21
ADD
cold
ADD
meat
ADD
and
ADD
bread
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
still
ADD
lying
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
table
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
host’s
ADD
supper,
ADD
and
ADD
devoured
ADD
it
ADD
voraciously.
ADD
“Does
ADD
Lucy
ADD
bear
ADD
up
ADD
well?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked,
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
satisfied
ADD
his
ADD
hunger.
ADD

ADD
“Yes.
ADD
She
ADD
does
ADD
not
ADD
know
ADD
the
ADD
danger,”
ADD
her
ADD
father
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
is
ADD
well.
ADD
The
ADD
house
ADD
is
ADD
watched
ADD
on
ADD
every
ADD
side.
ADD
That
ADD
is
ADD
why
ADD
I
ADD
crawled
ADD
my
ADD
way
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
it.
ADD
They
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
darned
ADD
sharp,
ADD
but
ADD
they’re
ADD
not
ADD
quite
ADD
sharp
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
catch
ADD
a
ADD
Washoe
ADD
hunter.”
ADD

ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
felt
ADD
a
ADD
different
ADD
man
ADD
now
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
realized
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
devoted
ADD
ally.
ADD
He
ADD
seized
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
man’s
ADD
leathery
ADD
hand
ADD
and
ADD
wrung
ADD
it
ADD
cordially.
ADD
“You’re
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
proud
ADD
of,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“There
ADD
are
ADD
not
ADD
many
ADD
who
ADD
would
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
share
ADD
our
ADD
danger
ADD
and
ADD
our
ADD
troubles.”
ADD

ADD
“You’ve
ADD
hit
ADD
it
ADD
there,
ADD
pard,”
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
hunter
ADD
answered.
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
respect
ADD
for
ADD
you,
ADD
but
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
were
ADD
alone
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
business
ADD
I’d
ADD
think
ADD
twice
ADD
before
ADD
I
ADD
put
ADD
my
ADD
head
ADD
into
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
hornet’s
ADD
nest.
ADD
It’s
ADD
Lucy
ADD
that
ADD
brings
ADD
me
ADD
here,
ADD
and
ADD
before
ADD
harm
ADD
comes
ADD
on
ADD
her
ADD
I
ADD
guess
ADD
there
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
one
ADD
less
ADD
o’
ADD
the
ADD
Hope
ADD
family
ADD
in
ADD
Utah.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
are
ADD
we
ADD
to
ADD
do?”
ADD

ADD
“To-morrow
ADD
is
ADD
your
ADD
last
ADD
day,
ADD
and
ADD
unless
ADD
you
ADD
act
ADD
to-night
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
lost.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
mule
ADD
and
ADD
two
ADD
horses
ADD
waiting
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Eagle
ADD
Ravine.
ADD
How
ADD
much
ADD
money
ADD
have
ADD
you?”
ADD

ADD
“Two
ADD
thousand
ADD
dollars
ADD
in
ADD
gold,
ADD
and
ADD
five
ADD
in
ADD
notes.”
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
will
ADD
do.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
as
ADD
much
ADD
more
ADD
to
ADD
add
ADD
to
ADD
it.
ADD
We
ADD
must
ADD
push
ADD
for
ADD
Carson
ADD
City
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
mountains.
ADD
You
ADD
had
ADD
best
ADD
wake
ADD
Lucy.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
servants
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
sleep
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
house.”
ADD

ADD
While
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
was
ADD
absent,
ADD
preparing
ADD
his
ADD
daughter
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
approaching
ADD
journey,
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
packed
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
eatables
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
find
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
parcel,
ADD
and
ADD
filled
ADD
a
ADD
stoneware
ADD
jar
ADD
with
ADD
water,
ADD
for
ADD
he
ADD
knew
ADD
by
ADD
experience
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
mountain
ADD
wells
ADD
were
ADD
few
ADD
and
ADD
far
ADD
between.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
hardly
ADD
completed
ADD
his
ADD
arrangements
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
farmer
ADD
returned
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
daughter
ADD
all
ADD
dressed
ADD
and
ADD
ready
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
start.
ADD
The
ADD
greeting
ADD
between
ADD
the
ADD
lovers
ADD
was
ADD
warm,
ADD
but
ADD
brief,
ADD
for
ADD
minutes
ADD
were
ADD
precious,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
much
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
done.
ADD

ADD
“We
ADD
must
ADD
make
ADD
our
ADD
start
ADD
at
ADD
once,”
ADD
said
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,
ADD
speaking
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
low
ADD
but
ADD
resolute
ADD
voice,
ADD
like
ADD
one
ADD
who
ADD
realizes
ADD
the
ADD
greatness
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
peril,
ADD
but
ADD
has
ADD
steeled
ADD
his
ADD
heart
ADD
to
ADD
meet
ADD
it.
ADD
“The
ADD
front
ADD
and
ADD
back
ADD
entrances
ADD
are
ADD
watched,
ADD
but
ADD
with
ADD
caution
ADD
we
ADD
may
ADD
get
ADD
away
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
side
ADD
window
ADD
and
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
fields.
ADD
Once
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
only
ADD
two
ADD
miles
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
Ravine
ADD
where
ADD
the
ADD
horses
ADD
are
ADD
waiting.
ADD
By
ADD
daybreak
ADD
we
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
half-way
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
mountains.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
if
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
stopped,”
ADD
asked
ADD
Ferrier.
ADD

ADD
Hope
ADD
slapped
ADD
the
ADD
revolver
ADD
butt
ADD
which
ADD
protruded
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
tunic.
ADD
“If
ADD
they
ADD
are
ADD
too
ADD
many
ADD
for
ADD
us
ADD
we
ADD
shall
ADD
take
ADD
two
ADD
or
ADD
three
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
with
ADD
us,”
ADD
he
ADD
said
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
sinister
ADD
smile.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
lights
ADD
inside
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
had
ADD
all
ADD
been
ADD
extinguished,
ADD
and
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
darkened
ADD
window
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
peered
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
fields
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
his
ADD
own,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
now
ADD
about
ADD
to
ADD
abandon
ADD
for
ADD
ever.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
long
ADD
nerved
ADD
himself
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
sacrifice,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
honour
ADD
and
ADD
happiness
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
daughter
ADD
outweighed
ADD
any
ADD
regret
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
ruined
ADD
fortunes.
ADD
All
ADD
looked
ADD
so
ADD
peaceful
ADD
and
ADD
happy,
ADD
the
ADD
rustling
ADD
trees
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
broad
ADD
silent
ADD
stretch
ADD
of
ADD
grain-land,
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
difficult
ADD
to
ADD
realize
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
spirit
ADD
of
ADD
murder
ADD
lurked
ADD
through
ADD
it
ADD
all.
ADD
Yet
ADD
the
ADD
white
ADD
face
ADD
and
ADD
set
ADD
expression
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
hunter
ADD
showed
ADD
that
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
approach
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
seen
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
satisfy
ADD
him
ADD
upon
ADD
that
ADD
head.
ADD

ADD
Ferrier
ADD
carried
ADD
the
ADD
bag
ADD
of
ADD
gold
ADD
and
ADD
notes,
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
scanty
ADD
provisions
ADD
and
ADD
water,
ADD
while
ADD
Lucy
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
bundle
ADD
containing
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
more
ADD
valued
ADD
possessions.
ADD
Opening
ADD
the
ADD
window
ADD
very
ADD
slowly
ADD
and
ADD
carefully,
ADD
they
ADD
waited
ADD
until
ADD
a
ADD
dark
ADD
cloud
ADD
had
ADD
somewhat
ADD
obscured
ADD
the
ADD
night,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
one
ADD
by
ADD
one
ADD
passed
ADD
through
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
garden.
ADD
With
ADD
bated
ADD
breath
ADD
and
ADD
crouching
ADD
figures
ADD
they
ADD
stumbled
ADD
across
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
gained
ADD
the
ADD
shelter
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
hedge,
ADD
which
ADD
they
ADD
skirted
ADD
until
ADD
they
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
gap
ADD
which
ADD
opened
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
cornfields.
ADD
They
ADD
had
ADD
just
ADD
reached
ADD
this
ADD
point
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
man
ADD
seized
ADD
his
ADD
two
ADD
companions
ADD
and
ADD
dragged
ADD
them
ADD
down
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
shadow,
ADD
where
ADD
they
ADD
lay
ADD
silent
ADD
and
ADD
trembling.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
prairie
ADD
training
ADD
had
ADD
given
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
the
ADD
ears
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
lynx.
ADD
He
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
friends
ADD
had
ADD
hardly
ADD
crouched
ADD
down
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
melancholy
ADD
hooting
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
mountain
ADD
owl
ADD
was
ADD
heard
ADD
within
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
yards
ADD
of
ADD
them,
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
immediately
ADD
answered
ADD
by
ADD
another
ADD
hoot
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
distance.
ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
moment
ADD
a
ADD
vague
ADD
shadowy
ADD
figure
ADD
emerged
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
gap
ADD
for
ADD
which
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
making,
ADD
and
ADD
uttered
ADD
the
ADD
plaintive
ADD
signal
ADD
cry
ADD
again,
ADD
on
ADD
which
ADD
a
ADD
second
ADD
man
ADD
appeared
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
obscurity.
ADD

ADD
“To-morrow
ADD
at
ADD
midnight,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
who
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
in
ADD
authority.
ADD
“When
ADD
the
ADD
Whip-poor-Will
ADD
calls
ADD
three
ADD
times.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
well,”
ADD
returned
ADD
the
ADD
other.
ADD
“Shall
ADD
I
ADD
tell
ADD
Brother
ADD
Drebber?”
ADD

ADD
“Pass
ADD
it
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
from
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
others.
ADD
Nine
ADD
to
ADD
seven!”
ADD

ADD
“Seven
ADD
to
ADD
five!”
ADD
repeated
ADD
the
ADD
other,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
figures
ADD
flitted
ADD
away
ADD
in
ADD
different
ADD
directions.
ADD
Their
ADD
concluding
ADD
words
ADD
had
ADD
evidently
ADD
been
ADD
some
ADD
form
ADD
of
ADD
sign
ADD
and
ADD
countersign.
ADD
The
ADD
instant
ADD
that
ADD
their
ADD
footsteps
ADD
had
ADD
died
ADD
away
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
distance,
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
sprang
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
feet,
ADD
and
ADD
helping
ADD
his
ADD
companions
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
gap,
ADD
led
ADD
the
ADD
way
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
fields
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
top
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
speed,
ADD
supporting
ADD
and
ADD
half-carrying
ADD
the
ADD
girl
ADD
when
ADD
her
ADD
strength
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
fail
ADD
her.
ADD

ADD
“Hurry
ADD
on!
ADD
hurry
ADD
on!”
ADD
he
ADD
gasped
ADD
from
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
time.
ADD
“We
ADD
are
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
line
ADD
of
ADD
sentinels.
ADD
Everything
ADD
depends
ADD
on
ADD
speed.
ADD
Hurry
ADD
on!”
ADD

ADD
Once
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
high
ADD
road
ADD
they
ADD
made
ADD
rapid
ADD
progress.
ADD
Only
ADD
once
ADD
did
ADD
they
ADD
meet
ADD
anyone,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
they
ADD
managed
ADD
to
ADD
slip
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
field,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
avoid
ADD
recognition.
ADD
Before
ADD
reaching
ADD
the
ADD
town
ADD
the
ADD
hunter
ADD
branched
ADD
away
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
rugged
ADD
and
ADD
narrow
ADD
footpath
ADD
which
ADD
led
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
mountains.
ADD
Two
ADD
dark
ADD
jagged
ADD
peaks
ADD
loomed
ADD
above
ADD
them
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
darkness,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
defile
ADD
which
ADD
led
ADD
between
ADD
them
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
Eagle
ADD
Cañon
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
horses
ADD
were
ADD
awaiting
ADD
them.
ADD
With
ADD
unerring
ADD
instinct
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
picked
ADD
his
ADD
way
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
boulders
ADD
and
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
bed
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
dried-up
ADD
watercourse,
ADD
until
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
retired
ADD
corner,
ADD
screened
ADD
with
ADD
rocks,
ADD
where
ADD
the
ADD
faithful
ADD
animals
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
picketed.
ADD
The
ADD
girl
ADD
was
ADD
placed
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
mule,
ADD
and
ADD
old
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
upon
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
horses,
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
money-bag,
ADD
while
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
led
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
along
ADD
the
ADD
precipitous
ADD
and
ADD
dangerous
ADD
path.
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
bewildering
ADD
route
ADD
for
ADD
anyone
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
accustomed
ADD
to
ADD
face
ADD
Nature
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
wildest
ADD
moods.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
one
ADD
side
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
crag
ADD
towered
ADD
up
ADD
a
ADD
thousand
ADD
feet
ADD
or
ADD
more,
ADD
black,
ADD
stern,
ADD
and
ADD
menacing,
ADD
with
ADD
long
ADD
basaltic
ADD
columns
ADD
upon
ADD
its
ADD
rugged
ADD
surface
ADD
like
ADD
the
ADD
ribs
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
petrified
ADD
monster.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
hand
ADD
a
ADD
wild
ADD
chaos
ADD
of
ADD
boulders
ADD
and
ADD
debris
ADD
made
ADD
all
ADD
advance
ADD
impossible.
ADD
Between
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
ran
ADD
the
ADD
irregular
ADD
track,
ADD
so
ADD
narrow
ADD
in
ADD
places
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
travel
ADD
in
ADD
Indian
ADD
file,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
rough
ADD
that
ADD
only
ADD
practised
ADD
riders
ADD
could
ADD
have
ADD
traversed
ADD
it
ADD
at
ADD
all.
ADD
Yet
ADD
in
ADD
spite
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
dangers
ADD
and
ADD
difficulties,
ADD
the
ADD
hearts
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
fugitives
ADD
were
ADD
light
ADD
within
ADD
them,
ADD
for
ADD
every
ADD
step
ADD
increased
ADD
the
ADD
distance
ADD
between
ADD
them
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
terrible
ADD
despotism
ADD
from
ADD
which
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
flying.
ADD

ADD
They
ADD
soon
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
proof,
ADD
however,
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
still
ADD
within
ADD
the
ADD
jurisdiction
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Saints.
ADD
They
ADD
had
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
wildest
ADD
and
ADD
most
ADD
desolate
ADD
portion
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
pass
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
girl
ADD
gave
ADD
a
ADD
startled
ADD
cry,
ADD
and
ADD
pointed
ADD
upwards.
ADD
On
ADD
a
ADD
rock
ADD
which
ADD
overlooked
ADD
the
ADD
track,
ADD
showing
ADD
out
ADD
dark
ADD
and
ADD
plain
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
sky,
ADD
there
ADD
stood
ADD
a
ADD
solitary
ADD
sentinel.
ADD
He
ADD
saw
ADD
them
ADD
as
ADD
soon
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
perceived
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
military
ADD
challenge
ADD
of
ADD
“Who
ADD
goes
ADD
there?”
ADD
rang
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
silent
ADD
ravine.
ADD

ADD
“Travellers
ADD
for
ADD
Nevada,”
ADD
said
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
hand
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
rifle
ADD
which
ADD
hung
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
saddle.
ADD

ADD
They
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
the
ADD
lonely
ADD
watcher
ADD
fingering
ADD
his
ADD
gun,
ADD
and
ADD
peering
ADD
down
ADD
at
ADD
them
ADD
as
ADD
if
ADD
dissatisfied
ADD
at
ADD
their
ADD
reply.
ADD

ADD
“By
ADD
whose
ADD
permission?”
ADD
he
ADD
asked.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
Holy
ADD
Four,”
ADD
answered
ADD
Ferrier.
ADD
His
ADD
Mormon
ADD
experiences
ADD
had
ADD
taught
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
highest
ADD
authority
ADD
to
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
refer.
ADD

ADD
“Nine
ADD
from
ADD
seven,”
ADD
cried
ADD
the
ADD
sentinel.
ADD

ADD
“Seven
ADD
from
ADD
five,”
ADD
returned
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
promptly,
ADD
remembering
ADD
the
ADD
countersign
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
heard
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
garden.
ADD

ADD
“Pass,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
Lord
ADD
go
ADD
with
ADD
you,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
voice
ADD
from
ADD
above.
ADD
Beyond
ADD
his
ADD
post
ADD
the
ADD
path
ADD
broadened
ADD
out,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
horses
ADD
were
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
break
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
trot.
ADD
Looking
ADD
back,
ADD
they
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
the
ADD
solitary
ADD
watcher
ADD
leaning
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
gun,
ADD
and
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
passed
ADD
the
ADD
outlying
ADD
post
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
chosen
ADD
people,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
freedom
ADD
lay
ADD
before
ADD
them.

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
V.
ADD
THE
ADD
AVENGING
ADD
ANGELS.
ADD

ADD
ALL
ADD
night
ADD
their
ADD
course
ADD
lay
ADD
through
ADD
intricate
ADD
defiles
ADD
and
ADD
over
ADD
irregular
ADD
and
ADD
rock-strewn
ADD
paths.
ADD
More
ADD
than
ADD
once
ADD
they
ADD
lost
ADD
their
ADD
way,
ADD
but
ADD
Hope’s
ADD
intimate
ADD
knowledge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
enabled
ADD
them
ADD
to
ADD
regain
ADD
the
ADD
track
ADD
once
ADD
more.
ADD
When
ADD
morning
ADD
broke,
ADD
a
ADD
scene
ADD
of
ADD
marvellous
ADD
though
ADD
savage
ADD
beauty
ADD
lay
ADD
before
ADD
them.
ADD
In
ADD
every
ADD
direction
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
snow-capped
ADD
peaks
ADD
hemmed
ADD
them
ADD
in,
ADD
peeping
ADD
over
ADD
each
ADD
other’s
ADD
shoulders
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
far
ADD
horizon.
ADD
So
ADD
steep
ADD
were
ADD
the
ADD
rocky
ADD
banks
ADD
on
ADD
either
ADD
side
ADD
of
ADD
them,
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
larch
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
pine
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
suspended
ADD
over
ADD
their
ADD
heads,
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
need
ADD
only
ADD
a
ADD
gust
ADD
of
ADD
wind
ADD
to
ADD
come
ADD
hurtling
ADD
down
ADD
upon
ADD
them.
ADD
Nor
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
fear
ADD
entirely
ADD
an
ADD
illusion,
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
barren
ADD
valley
ADD
was
ADD
thickly
ADD
strewn
ADD
with
ADD
trees
ADD
and
ADD
boulders
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
fallen
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
similar
ADD
manner.
ADD
Even
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
passed,
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
rock
ADD
came
ADD
thundering
ADD
down
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
hoarse
ADD
rattle
ADD
which
ADD
woke
ADD
the
ADD
echoes
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
silent
ADD
gorges,
ADD
and
ADD
startled
ADD
the
ADD
weary
ADD
horses
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
gallop.
ADD

ADD
As
ADD
the
ADD
sun
ADD
rose
ADD
slowly
ADD
above
ADD
the
ADD
eastern
ADD
horizon,
ADD
the
ADD
caps
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
mountains
ADD
lit
ADD
up
ADD
one
ADD
after
ADD
the
ADD
other,
ADD
like
ADD
lamps
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
festival,
ADD
until
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
all
ADD
ruddy
ADD
and
ADD
glowing.
ADD
The
ADD
magnificent
ADD
spectacle
ADD
cheered
ADD
the
ADD
hearts
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
three
ADD
fugitives
ADD
and
ADD
gave
ADD
them
ADD
fresh
ADD
energy.
ADD
At
ADD
a
ADD
wild
ADD
torrent
ADD
which
ADD
swept
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
ravine
ADD
they
ADD
called
ADD
a
ADD
halt
ADD
and
ADD
watered
ADD
their
ADD
horses,
ADD
while
ADD
they
ADD
partook
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
hasty
ADD
breakfast.
ADD
Lucy
ADD
and
ADD
her
ADD
father
ADD
would
ADD
fain
ADD
have
ADD
rested
ADD
longer,
ADD
but
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
was
ADD
inexorable.
ADD
“They
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
upon
ADD
our
ADD
track
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
time,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“Everything
ADD
depends
ADD
upon
ADD
our
ADD
speed.
ADD
Once
ADD
safe
ADD
in
ADD
Carson
ADD
we
ADD
may
ADD
rest
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
remainder
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
lives.”
ADD

ADD
During
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
day
ADD
they
ADD
struggled
ADD
on
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
defiles,
ADD
and
ADD
by
ADD
evening
ADD
they
ADD
calculated
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
thirty
ADD
miles
ADD
from
ADD
their
ADD
enemies.
ADD
At
ADD
night-time
ADD
they
ADD
chose
ADD
the
ADD
base
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
beetling
ADD
crag,
ADD
where
ADD
the
ADD
rocks
ADD
offered
ADD
some
ADD
protection
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
chill
ADD
wind,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
huddled
ADD
together
ADD
for
ADD
warmth,
ADD
they
ADD
enjoyed
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
hours’
ADD
sleep.
ADD
Before
ADD
daybreak,
ADD
however,
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
their
ADD
way
ADD
once
ADD
more.
ADD
They
ADD
had
ADD
seen
ADD
no
ADD
signs
ADD
of
ADD
any
ADD
pursuers,
ADD
and
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
think
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
fairly
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
reach
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
terrible
ADD
organization
ADD
whose
ADD
enmity
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
incurred.
ADD
He
ADD
little
ADD
knew
ADD
how
ADD
far
ADD
that
ADD
iron
ADD
grasp
ADD
could
ADD
reach,
ADD
or
ADD
how
ADD
soon
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
close
ADD
upon
ADD
them
ADD
and
ADD
crush
ADD
them.
ADD

ADD
About
ADD
the
ADD
middle
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
second
ADD
day
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
flight
ADD
their
ADD
scanty
ADD
store
ADD
of
ADD
provisions
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
run
ADD
out.
ADD
This
ADD
gave
ADD
the
ADD
hunter
ADD
little
ADD
uneasiness,
ADD
however,
ADD
for
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
game
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
had
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
mountains,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
frequently
ADD
before
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
depend
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
rifle
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
needs
ADD
of
ADD
life.
ADD
Choosing
ADD
a
ADD
sheltered
ADD
nook,
ADD
he
ADD
piled
ADD
together
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
dried
ADD
branches
ADD
and
ADD
made
ADD
a
ADD
blazing
ADD
fire,
ADD
at
ADD
which
ADD
his
ADD
companions
ADD
might
ADD
warm
ADD
themselves,
ADD
for
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
now
ADD
nearly
ADD
five
ADD
thousand
ADD
feet
ADD
above
ADD
the
ADD
sea
ADD
level,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
air
ADD
was
ADD
bitter
ADD
and
ADD
keen.
ADD
Having
ADD
tethered
ADD
the
ADD
horses,
ADD
and
ADD
bade
ADD
Lucy
ADD
adieu,
ADD
he
ADD
threw
ADD
his
ADD
gun
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
shoulder,
ADD
and
ADD
set
ADD
out
ADD
in
ADD
search
ADD
of
ADD
whatever
ADD
chance
ADD
might
ADD
throw
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
way.
ADD
Looking
ADD
back
ADD
he
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
man
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
girl
ADD
crouching
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
blazing
ADD
fire,
ADD
while
ADD
the
ADD
three
ADD
animals
ADD
stood
ADD
motionless
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
back-ground.
ADD
Then
ADD
the
ADD
intervening
ADD
rocks
ADD
hid
ADD
them
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
view.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
walked
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
couple
ADD
of
ADD
miles
ADD
through
ADD
one
ADD
ravine
ADD
after
ADD
another
ADD
without
ADD
success,
ADD
though
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
marks
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
bark
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
trees,
ADD
and
ADD
other
ADD
indications,
ADD
he
ADD
judged
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
numerous
ADD
bears
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
vicinity.
ADD
At
ADD
last,
ADD
after
ADD
two
ADD
or
ADD
three
ADD
hours’
ADD
fruitless
ADD
search,
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
thinking
ADD
of
ADD
turning
ADD
back
ADD
in
ADD
despair,
ADD
when
ADD
casting
ADD
his
ADD
eyes
ADD
upwards
ADD
he
ADD
saw
ADD
a
ADD
sight
ADD
which
ADD
sent
ADD
a
ADD
thrill
ADD
of
ADD
pleasure
ADD
through
ADD
his
ADD
heart.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
edge
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
jutting
ADD
pinnacle,
ADD
three
ADD
or
ADD
four
ADD
hundred
ADD
feet
ADD
above
ADD
him,
ADD
there
ADD
stood
ADD
a
ADD
creature
ADD
somewhat
ADD
resembling
ADD
a
ADD
sheep
ADD
in
ADD
appearance,
ADD
but
ADD
armed
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
pair
ADD
of
ADD
gigantic
ADD
horns.
ADD
The
ADD
big-horn—for
ADD
so
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
called—was
ADD
acting,
ADD
probably,
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
guardian
ADD
over
ADD
a
ADD
flock
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
invisible
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
hunter;
ADD
but
ADD
fortunately
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
heading
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
opposite
ADD
direction,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
perceived
ADD
him.
ADD
Lying
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
face,
ADD
he
ADD
rested
ADD
his
ADD
rifle
ADD
upon
ADD
a
ADD
rock,
ADD
and
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
long
ADD
and
ADD
steady
ADD
aim
ADD
before
ADD
drawing
ADD
the
ADD
trigger.
ADD
The
ADD
animal
ADD
sprang
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
air,
ADD
tottered
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
moment
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
edge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
precipice,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
came
ADD
crashing
ADD
down
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
valley
ADD
beneath.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
creature
ADD
was
ADD
too
ADD
unwieldy
ADD
to
ADD
lift,
ADD
so
ADD
the
ADD
hunter
ADD
contented
ADD
himself
ADD
with
ADD
cutting
ADD
away
ADD
one
ADD
haunch
ADD
and
ADD
part
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
flank.
ADD
With
ADD
this
ADD
trophy
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
shoulder,
ADD
he
ADD
hastened
ADD
to
ADD
retrace
ADD
his
ADD
steps,
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
evening
ADD
was
ADD
already
ADD
drawing
ADD
in.
ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
hardly
ADD
started,
ADD
however,
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
realized
ADD
the
ADD
difficulty
ADD
which
ADD
faced
ADD
him.
ADD
In
ADD
his
ADD
eagerness
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
wandered
ADD
far
ADD
past
ADD
the
ADD
ravines
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
known
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
easy
ADD
matter
ADD
to
ADD
pick
ADD
out
ADD
the
ADD
path
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
taken.
ADD
The
ADD
valley
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
found
ADD
himself
ADD
divided
ADD
and
ADD
sub-divided
ADD
into
ADD
many
ADD
gorges,
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
so
ADD
like
ADD
each
ADD
other
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
impossible
ADD
to
ADD
distinguish
ADD
one
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
other.
ADD
He
ADD
followed
ADD
one
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
mile
ADD
or
ADD
more
ADD
until
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
mountain
ADD
torrent
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
sure
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
never
ADD
seen
ADD
before.
ADD
Convinced
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
taken
ADD
the
ADD
wrong
ADD
turn,
ADD
he
ADD
tried
ADD
another,
ADD
but
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
result.
ADD
Night
ADD
was
ADD
coming
ADD
on
ADD
rapidly,
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
almost
ADD
dark
ADD
before
ADD
he
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
found
ADD
himself
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
defile
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
familiar
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
Even
ADD
then
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
easy
ADD
matter
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
right
ADD
track,
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
moon
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
yet
ADD
risen,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
high
ADD
cliffs
ADD
on
ADD
either
ADD
side
ADD
made
ADD
the
ADD
obscurity
ADD
more
ADD
profound.
ADD
Weighed
ADD
down
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
burden,
ADD
and
ADD
weary
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
exertions,
ADD
he
ADD
stumbled
ADD
along,
ADD
keeping
ADD
up
ADD
his
ADD
heart
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
reflection
ADD
that
ADD
every
ADD
step
ADD
brought
ADD
him
ADD
nearer
ADD
to
ADD
Lucy,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
carried
ADD
with
ADD
him
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
ensure
ADD
them
ADD
food
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
remainder
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
journey.
ADD

ADD
He
ADD
had
ADD
now
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
mouth
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
defile
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
left
ADD
them.
ADD
Even
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
darkness
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
recognize
ADD
the
ADD
outline
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
cliffs
ADD
which
ADD
bounded
ADD
it.
ADD
They
ADD
must,
ADD
he
ADD
reflected,
ADD
be
ADD
awaiting
ADD
him
ADD
anxiously,
ADD
for
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
absent
ADD
nearly
ADD
five
ADD
hours.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
gladness
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
heart
ADD
he
ADD
put
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
mouth
ADD
and
ADD
made
ADD
the
ADD
glen
ADD
re-echo
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
loud
ADD
halloo
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
signal
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
coming.
ADD
He
ADD
paused
ADD
and
ADD
listened
ADD
for
ADD
an
ADD
answer.
ADD
None
ADD
came
ADD
save
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
cry,
ADD
which
ADD
clattered
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
dreary
ADD
silent
ADD
ravines,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
borne
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
ears
ADD
in
ADD
countless
ADD
repetitions.
ADD
Again
ADD
he
ADD
shouted,
ADD
even
ADD
louder
ADD
than
ADD
before,
ADD
and
ADD
again
ADD
no
ADD
whisper
ADD
came
ADD
back
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
friends
ADD
whom
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
left
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
short
ADD
time
ADD
ago.
ADD
A
ADD
vague,
ADD
nameless
ADD
dread
ADD
came
ADD
over
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
hurried
ADD
onwards
ADD
frantically,
ADD
dropping
ADD
the
ADD
precious
ADD
food
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
agitation.
ADD

ADD
When
ADD
he
ADD
turned
ADD
the
ADD
corner,
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
full
ADD
in
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
spot
ADD
where
ADD
the
ADD
fire
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
lit.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
a
ADD
glowing
ADD
pile
ADD
of
ADD
wood
ADD
ashes
ADD
there,
ADD
but
ADD
it
ADD
had
ADD
evidently
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
tended
ADD
since
ADD
his
ADD
departure.
ADD
The
ADD
same
ADD
dead
ADD
silence
ADD
still
ADD
reigned
ADD
all
ADD
round.
ADD
With
ADD
his
ADD
fears
ADD
all
ADD
changed
ADD
to
ADD
convictions,
ADD
he
ADD
hurried
ADD
on.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
living
ADD
creature
ADD
near
ADD
the
ADD
remains
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
fire:
ADD
animals,
ADD
man,
ADD
maiden,
ADD
all
ADD
were
ADD
gone.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
only
ADD
too
ADD
clear
ADD
that
ADD
some
ADD
sudden
ADD
and
ADD
terrible
ADD
disaster
ADD
had
ADD
occurred
ADD
during
ADD
his
ADD
absence—a
ADD
disaster
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
embraced
ADD
them
ADD
all,
ADD
and
ADD
yet
ADD
had
ADD
left
ADD
no
ADD
traces
ADD
behind
ADD
it.
ADD

ADD
Bewildered
ADD
and
ADD
stunned
ADD
by
ADD
this
ADD
blow,
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
felt
ADD
his
ADD
head
ADD
spin
ADD
round,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
lean
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
rifle
ADD
to
ADD
save
ADD
himself
ADD
from
ADD
falling.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
essentially
ADD
a
ADD
man
ADD
of
ADD
action,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
speedily
ADD
recovered
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
temporary
ADD
impotence.
ADD
Seizing
ADD
a
ADD
half-consumed
ADD
piece
ADD
of
ADD
wood
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
smouldering
ADD
fire,
ADD
he
ADD
blew
ADD
it
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
flame,
ADD
and
ADD
proceeded
ADD
with
ADD
its
ADD
help
ADD
to
ADD
examine
ADD
the
ADD
little
ADD
camp.
ADD
The
ADD
ground
ADD
was
ADD
all
ADD
stamped
ADD
down
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
feet
ADD
of
ADD
horses,
ADD
showing
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
party
ADD
of
ADD
mounted
ADD
men
ADD
had
ADD
overtaken
ADD
the
ADD
fugitives,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
direction
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
tracks
ADD
proved
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
afterwards
ADD
turned
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City.
ADD
Had
ADD
they
ADD
carried
ADD
back
ADD
both
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
companions
ADD
with
ADD
them?
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
had
ADD
almost
ADD
persuaded
ADD
himself
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
done
ADD
so,
ADD
when
ADD
his
ADD
eye
ADD
fell
ADD
upon
ADD
an
ADD
object
ADD
which
ADD
made
ADD
every
ADD
nerve
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
body
ADD
tingle
ADD
within
ADD
him.
ADD
A
ADD
little
ADD
way
ADD
on
ADD
one
ADD
side
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
camp
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
low-lying
ADD
heap
ADD
of
ADD
reddish
ADD
soil,
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
assuredly
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
there
ADD
before.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
mistaking
ADD
it
ADD
for
ADD
anything
ADD
but
ADD
a
ADD
newly-dug
ADD
grave.
ADD
As
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
hunter
ADD
approached
ADD
it,
ADD
he
ADD
perceived
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
stick
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
planted
ADD
on
ADD
it,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
sheet
ADD
of
ADD
paper
ADD
stuck
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
cleft
ADD
fork
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
The
ADD
inscription
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
paper
ADD
was
ADD
brief,
ADD
but
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
point:
ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD
JOHN
ADD
FERRIER,
ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD
FORMERLY
ADD
OF
ADD
SALT
ADD
LAKE
ADD
CITY,
ADD
22
ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD

ADD
Died
ADD
August
ADD
4th,
ADD
1860.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
sturdy
ADD
old
ADD
man,
ADD
whom
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
left
ADD
so
ADD
short
ADD
a
ADD
time
ADD
before,
ADD
was
ADD
gone,
ADD
then,
ADD
and
ADD
this
ADD
was
ADD
all
ADD
his
ADD
epitaph.
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
looked
ADD
wildly
ADD
round
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
if
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
second
ADD
grave,
ADD
but
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
sign
ADD
of
ADD
one.
ADD
Lucy
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
carried
ADD
back
ADD
by
ADD
their
ADD
terrible
ADD
pursuers
ADD
to
ADD
fulfil
ADD
her
ADD
original
ADD
destiny,
ADD
by
ADD
becoming
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
harem
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Elder’s
ADD
son.
ADD
As
ADD
the
ADD
young
ADD
fellow
ADD
realized
ADD
the
ADD
certainty
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
fate,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
powerlessness
ADD
to
ADD
prevent
ADD
it,
ADD
he
ADD
wished
ADD
that
ADD
he,
ADD
too,
ADD
was
ADD
lying
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
farmer
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
last
ADD
silent
ADD
resting-place.
ADD

ADD
Again,
ADD
however,
ADD
his
ADD
active
ADD
spirit
ADD
shook
ADD
off
ADD
the
ADD
lethargy
ADD
which
ADD
springs
ADD
from
ADD
despair.
ADD
If
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
nothing
ADD
else
ADD
left
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
at
ADD
least
ADD
devote
ADD
his
ADD
life
ADD
to
ADD
revenge.
ADD
With
ADD
indomitable
ADD
patience
ADD
and
ADD
perseverance,
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
possessed
ADD
also
ADD
a
ADD
power
ADD
of
ADD
sustained
ADD
vindictiveness,
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
may
ADD
have
ADD
learned
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
Indians
ADD
amongst
ADD
whom
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
lived.
ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
stood
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
desolate
ADD
fire,
ADD
he
ADD
felt
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
only
ADD
one
ADD
thing
ADD
which
ADD
could
ADD
assuage
ADD
his
ADD
grief
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
thorough
ADD
and
ADD
complete
ADD
retribution,
ADD
brought
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
hand
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
enemies.
ADD
His
ADD
strong
ADD
will
ADD
and
ADD
untiring
ADD
energy
ADD
should,
ADD
he
ADD
determined,
ADD
be
ADD
devoted
ADD
to
ADD
that
ADD
one
ADD
end.
ADD
With
ADD
a
ADD
grim,
ADD
white
ADD
face,
ADD
he
ADD
retraced
ADD
his
ADD
steps
ADD
to
ADD
where
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
dropped
ADD
the
ADD
food,
ADD
and
ADD
having
ADD
stirred
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
smouldering
ADD
fire,
ADD
he
ADD
cooked
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
last
ADD
him
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
days.
ADD
This
ADD
he
ADD
made
ADD
up
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
bundle,
ADD
and,
ADD
tired
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
was,
ADD
he
ADD
set
ADD
himself
ADD
to
ADD
walk
ADD
back
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
track
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
avenging
ADD
angels.
ADD

ADD
For
ADD
five
ADD
days
ADD
he
ADD
toiled
ADD
footsore
ADD
and
ADD
weary
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
defiles
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
traversed
ADD
on
ADD
horseback.
ADD
At
ADD
night
ADD
he
ADD
flung
ADD
himself
ADD
down
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
rocks,
ADD
and
ADD
snatched
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
hours
ADD
of
ADD
sleep;
ADD
but
ADD
before
ADD
daybreak
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
always
ADD
well
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
way.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
sixth
ADD
day,
ADD
he
ADD
reached
ADD
the
ADD
Eagle
ADD
Cañon,
ADD
from
ADD
which
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
commenced
ADD
their
ADD
ill-fated
ADD
flight.
ADD
Thence
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
look
ADD
down
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
home
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
saints.
ADD
Worn
ADD
and
ADD
exhausted,
ADD
he
ADD
leaned
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
rifle
ADD
and
ADD
shook
ADD
his
ADD
gaunt
ADD
hand
ADD
fiercely
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
silent
ADD
widespread
ADD
city
ADD
beneath
ADD
him.
ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
looked
ADD
at
ADD
it,
ADD
he
ADD
observed
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
flags
ADD
in
ADD
some
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
principal
ADD
streets,
ADD
and
ADD
other
ADD
signs
ADD
of
ADD
festivity.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
speculating
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
what
ADD
this
ADD
might
ADD
mean
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
heard
ADD
the
ADD
clatter
ADD
of
ADD
horse’s
ADD
hoofs,
ADD
and
ADD
saw
ADD
a
ADD
mounted
ADD
man
ADD
riding
ADD
towards
ADD
him.
ADD
As
ADD
he
ADD
approached,
ADD
he
ADD
recognized
ADD
him
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
Mormon
ADD
named
ADD
Cowper,
ADD
to
ADD
whom
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
rendered
ADD
services
ADD
at
ADD
different
ADD
times.
ADD
He
ADD
therefore
ADD
accosted
ADD
him
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
got
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
object
ADD
of
ADD
finding
ADD
out
ADD
what
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier’s
ADD
fate
ADD
had
ADD
been.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
am
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“You
ADD
remember
ADD
me.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
Mormon
ADD
looked
ADD
at
ADD
him
ADD
with
ADD
undisguised
ADD
astonishment—indeed,
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
difficult
ADD
to
ADD
recognize
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
tattered,
ADD
unkempt
ADD
wanderer,
ADD
with
ADD
ghastly
ADD
white
ADD
face
ADD
and
ADD
fierce,
ADD
wild
ADD
eyes,
ADD
the
ADD
spruce
ADD
young
ADD
hunter
ADD
of
ADD
former
ADD
days.
ADD
Having,
ADD
however,
ADD
at
ADD
last,
ADD
satisfied
ADD
himself
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
identity,
ADD
the
ADD
man’s
ADD
surprise
ADD
changed
ADD
to
ADD
consternation.
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
are
ADD
mad
ADD
to
ADD
come
ADD
here,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried.
ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
as
ADD
much
ADD
as
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
life
ADD
is
ADD
worth
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
seen
ADD
talking
ADD
with
ADD
you.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
warrant
ADD
against
ADD
you
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
Holy
ADD
Four
ADD
for
ADD
assisting
ADD
the
ADD
Ferriers
ADD
away.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
don’t
ADD
fear
ADD
them,
ADD
or
ADD
their
ADD
warrant,”
ADD
Hope
ADD
said,
ADD
earnestly.
ADD
“You
ADD
must
ADD
know
ADD
something
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
matter,
ADD
Cowper.
ADD
I
ADD
conjure
ADD
you
ADD
by
ADD
everything
ADD
you
ADD
hold
ADD
dear
ADD
to
ADD
answer
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
questions.
ADD
We
ADD
have
ADD
always
ADD
been
ADD
friends.
ADD
For
ADD
God’s
ADD
sake,
ADD
don’t
ADD
refuse
ADD
to
ADD
answer
ADD
me.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
is
ADD
it?”
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon
ADD
asked
ADD
uneasily.
ADD
“Be
ADD
quick.
ADD
The
ADD
very
ADD
rocks
ADD
have
ADD
ears
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
trees
ADD
eyes.”
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
has
ADD
become
ADD
of
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier?”
ADD

ADD
“She
ADD
was
ADD
married
ADD
yesterday
ADD
to
ADD
young
ADD
Drebber.
ADD
Hold
ADD
up,
ADD
man,
ADD
hold
ADD
up,
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
no
ADD
life
ADD
left
ADD
in
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
“Don’t
ADD
mind
ADD
me,”
ADD
said
ADD
Hope
ADD
faintly.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
white
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
lips,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
sunk
ADD
down
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
stone
ADD
against
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
leaning.
ADD
“Married,
ADD
you
ADD
say?”
ADD

ADD
“Married
ADD
yesterday—that’s
ADD
what
ADD
those
ADD
flags
ADD
are
ADD
for
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
Endowment
ADD
House.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
some
ADD
words
ADD
between
ADD
young
ADD
Drebber
ADD
and
ADD
young
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
her.
ADD
They’d
ADD
both
ADD
been
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
party
ADD
that
ADD
followed
ADD
them,
ADD
and
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
had
ADD
shot
ADD
her
ADD
father,
ADD
which
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
give
ADD
him
ADD
the
ADD
best
ADD
claim;
ADD
but
ADD
when
ADD
they
ADD
argued
ADD
it
ADD
out
ADD
in
ADD
council,
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
party
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
stronger,
ADD
so
ADD
the
ADD
Prophet
ADD
gave
ADD
her
ADD
over
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
No
ADD
one
ADD
won’t
ADD
have
ADD
her
ADD
very
ADD
long
ADD
though,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
death
ADD
in
ADD
her
ADD
face
ADD
yesterday.
ADD
She
ADD
is
ADD
more
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
ghost
ADD
than
ADD
a
ADD
woman.
ADD
Are
ADD
you
ADD
off,
ADD
then?”
ADD

ADD
“Yes,
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
off,”
ADD
said
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
risen
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
seat.
ADD
His
ADD
face
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
chiselled
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
marble,
ADD
so
ADD
hard
ADD
and
ADD
set
ADD
was
ADD
its
ADD
expression,
ADD
while
ADD
its
ADD
eyes
ADD
glowed
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
baleful
ADD
light.
ADD

ADD
“Where
ADD
are
ADD
you
ADD
going?”
ADD

ADD
“Never
ADD
mind,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered;
ADD
and,
ADD
slinging
ADD
his
ADD
weapon
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
shoulder,
ADD
strode
ADD
off
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
gorge
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
away
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
heart
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
haunts
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
wild
ADD
beasts.
ADD
Amongst
ADD
them
ADD
all
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
none
ADD
so
ADD
fierce
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
dangerous
ADD
as
ADD
himself.
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
prediction
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon
ADD
was
ADD
only
ADD
too
ADD
well
ADD
fulfilled.
ADD
Whether
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
terrible
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
her
ADD
father
ADD
or
ADD
the
ADD
effects
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
hateful
ADD
marriage
ADD
into
ADD
which
ADD
she
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
forced,
ADD
poor
ADD
Lucy
ADD
never
ADD
held
ADD
up
ADD
her
ADD
head
ADD
again,
ADD
but
ADD
pined
ADD
away
ADD
and
ADD
died
ADD
within
ADD
a
ADD
month.
ADD
Her
ADD
sottish
ADD
husband,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
married
ADD
her
ADD
principally
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
sake
ADD
of
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier’s
ADD
property,
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
affect
ADD
any
ADD
great
ADD
grief
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
bereavement;
ADD
but
ADD
his
ADD
other
ADD
wives
ADD
mourned
ADD
over
ADD
her,
ADD
and
ADD
sat
ADD
up
ADD
with
ADD
her
ADD
the
ADD
night
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
burial,
ADD
as
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
Mormon
ADD
custom.
ADD
They
ADD
were
ADD
grouped
ADD
round
ADD
the
ADD
bier
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
early
ADD
hours
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
morning,
ADD
when,
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
inexpressible
ADD
fear
ADD
and
ADD
astonishment,
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
was
ADD
flung
ADD
open,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
savage-looking,
ADD
weather-beaten
ADD
man
ADD
in
ADD
tattered
ADD
garments
ADD
strode
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
room.
ADD
Without
ADD
a
ADD
glance
ADD
or
ADD
a
ADD
word
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
cowering
ADD
women,
ADD
he
ADD
walked
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
white
ADD
silent
ADD
figure
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
once
ADD
contained
ADD
the
ADD
pure
ADD
soul
ADD
of
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier.
ADD
Stooping
ADD
over
ADD
her,
ADD
he
ADD
pressed
ADD
his
ADD
lips
ADD
reverently
ADD
to
ADD
her
ADD
cold
ADD
forehead,
ADD
and
ADD
then,
ADD
snatching
ADD
up
ADD
her
ADD
hand,
ADD
he
ADD
took
ADD
the
ADD
wedding-ring
ADD
from
ADD
her
ADD
finger.
ADD
“She
ADD
shall
ADD
not
ADD
be
ADD
buried
ADD
in
ADD
that,”
ADD
he
ADD
cried
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
fierce
ADD
snarl,
ADD
and
ADD
before
ADD
an
ADD
alarm
ADD
could
ADD
be
ADD
raised
ADD
sprang
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
stairs
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
gone.
ADD
So
ADD
strange
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
brief
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
episode,
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
watchers
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
found
ADD
it
ADD
hard
ADD
to
ADD
believe
ADD
it
ADD
themselves
ADD
or
ADD
persuade
ADD
other
ADD
people
ADD
of
ADD
it,
ADD
had
ADD
it
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
undeniable
ADD
fact
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
circlet
ADD
of
ADD
gold
ADD
which
ADD
marked
ADD
her
ADD
as
ADD
having
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
bride
ADD
had
ADD
disappeared.
ADD

ADD
For
ADD
some
ADD
months
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
lingered
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
mountains,
ADD
leading
ADD
a
ADD
strange
ADD
wild
ADD
life,
ADD
and
ADD
nursing
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
heart
ADD
the
ADD
fierce
ADD
desire
ADD
for
ADD
vengeance
ADD
which
ADD
possessed
ADD
him.
ADD
Tales
ADD
were
ADD
told
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
City
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
weird
ADD
figure
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
seen
ADD
prowling
ADD
about
ADD
the
ADD
suburbs,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
haunted
ADD
the
ADD
lonely
ADD
mountain
ADD
gorges.
ADD
Once
ADD
a
ADD
bullet
ADD
whistled
ADD
through
ADD
Stangerson’s
ADD
window
ADD
and
ADD
flattened
ADD
itself
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wall
ADD
within
ADD
a
ADD
foot
ADD
of
ADD
him.
ADD
On
ADD
another
ADD
occasion,
ADD
as
ADD
Drebber
ADD
passed
ADD
under
ADD
a
ADD
cliff
ADD
a
ADD
great
ADD
boulder
ADD
crashed
ADD
down
ADD
on
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
only
ADD
escaped
ADD
a
ADD
terrible
ADD
death
ADD
by
ADD
throwing
ADD
himself
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
face.
ADD
The
ADD
two
ADD
young
ADD
Mormons
ADD
were
ADD
not
ADD
long
ADD
in
ADD
discovering
ADD
the
ADD
reason
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
attempts
ADD
upon
ADD
their
ADD
lives,
ADD
and
ADD
led
ADD
repeated
ADD
expeditions
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
mountains
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
hope
ADD
of
ADD
capturing
ADD
or
ADD
killing
ADD
their
ADD
enemy,
ADD
but
ADD
always
ADD
without
ADD
success.
ADD
Then
ADD
they
ADD
adopted
ADD
the
ADD
precaution
ADD
of
ADD
never
ADD
going
ADD
out
ADD
alone
ADD
or
ADD
after
ADD
nightfall,
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
having
ADD
their
ADD
houses
ADD
guarded.
ADD
After
ADD
a
ADD
time
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
relax
ADD
these
ADD
measures,
ADD
for
ADD
nothing
ADD
was
ADD
either
ADD
heard
ADD
or
ADD
seen
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
opponent,
ADD
and
ADD
they
ADD
hoped
ADD
that
ADD
time
ADD
had
ADD
cooled
ADD
his
ADD
vindictiveness.
ADD

ADD
Far
ADD
from
ADD
doing
ADD
so,
ADD
it
ADD
had,
ADD
if
ADD
anything,
ADD
augmented
ADD
it.
ADD
The
ADD
hunter’s
ADD
mind
ADD
was
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
hard,
ADD
unyielding
ADD
nature,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
predominant
ADD
idea
ADD
of
ADD
revenge
ADD
had
ADD
taken
ADD
such
ADD
complete
ADD
possession
ADD
of
ADD
it
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
room
ADD
for
ADD
any
ADD
other
ADD
emotion.
ADD
He
ADD
was,
ADD
however,
ADD
above
ADD
all
ADD
things
ADD
practical.
ADD
He
ADD
soon
ADD
realized
ADD
that
ADD
even
ADD
his
ADD
iron
ADD
constitution
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
stand
ADD
the
ADD
incessant
ADD
strain
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
putting
ADD
upon
ADD
it.
ADD
Exposure
ADD
and
ADD
want
ADD
of
ADD
wholesome
ADD
food
ADD
were
ADD
wearing
ADD
him
ADD
out.
ADD
If
ADD
he
ADD
died
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
dog
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
mountains,
ADD
what
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
become
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
revenge
ADD
then?
ADD
And
ADD
yet
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
death
ADD
was
ADD
sure
ADD
to
ADD
overtake
ADD
him
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
persisted.
ADD
He
ADD
felt
ADD
that
ADD
that
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
play
ADD
his
ADD
enemy’s
ADD
game,
ADD
so
ADD
he
ADD
reluctantly
ADD
returned
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
Nevada
ADD
mines,
ADD
there
ADD
to
ADD
recruit
ADD
his
ADD
health
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
amass
ADD
money
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
allow
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
pursue
ADD
his
ADD
object
ADD
without
ADD
privation.
ADD

ADD
His
ADD
intention
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
absent
ADD
a
ADD
year
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
most,
ADD
but
ADD
a
ADD
combination
ADD
of
ADD
unforeseen
ADD
circumstances
ADD
prevented
ADD
his
ADD
leaving
ADD
the
ADD
mines
ADD
for
ADD
nearly
ADD
five.
ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
end
ADD
of
ADD
that
ADD
time,
ADD
however,
ADD
his
ADD
memory
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
wrongs
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
craving
ADD
for
ADD
revenge
ADD
were
ADD
quite
ADD
as
ADD
keen
ADD
as
ADD
on
ADD
that
ADD
memorable
ADD
night
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
stood
ADD
by
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier’s
ADD
grave.
ADD
Disguised,
ADD
and
ADD
under
ADD
an
ADD
assumed
ADD
name,
ADD
he
ADD
returned
ADD
to
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City,
ADD
careless
ADD
what
ADD
became
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
life,
ADD
as
ADD
long
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
obtained
ADD
what
ADD
he
ADD
knew
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
justice.
ADD
There
ADD
he
ADD
found
ADD
evil
ADD
tidings
ADD
awaiting
ADD
him.
ADD
There
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
schism
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
Chosen
ADD
People
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
months
ADD
before,
ADD
some
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
younger
ADD
members
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Church
ADD
having
ADD
rebelled
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
authority
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Elders,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
result
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
the
ADD
secession
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
certain
ADD
number
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
malcontents,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
left
ADD
Utah
ADD
and
ADD
become
ADD
Gentiles.
ADD
Among
ADD
these
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
Drebber
ADD
and
ADD
Stangerson;
ADD
and
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
knew
ADD
whither
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
gone.
ADD
Rumour
ADD
reported
ADD
that
ADD
Drebber
ADD
had
ADD
managed
ADD
to
ADD
convert
ADD
a
ADD
large
ADD
part
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
property
ADD
into
ADD
money,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
departed
ADD
a
ADD
wealthy
ADD
man,
ADD
while
ADD
his
ADD
companion,
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
was
ADD
comparatively
ADD
poor.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
clue
ADD
at
ADD
all,
ADD
however,
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
whereabouts.
ADD

ADD
Many
ADD
a
ADD
man,
ADD
however
ADD
vindictive,
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
abandoned
ADD
all
ADD
thought
ADD
of
ADD
revenge
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
face
ADD
of
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
difficulty,
ADD
but
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
never
ADD
faltered
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
moment.
ADD
With
ADD
the
ADD
small
ADD
competence
ADD
he
ADD
possessed,
ADD
eked
ADD
out
ADD
by
ADD
such
ADD
employment
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
pick
ADD
up,
ADD
he
ADD
travelled
ADD
from
ADD
town
ADD
to
ADD
town
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
United
ADD
States
ADD
in
ADD
quest
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
enemies.
ADD
Year
ADD
passed
ADD
into
ADD
year,
ADD
his
ADD
black
ADD
hair
ADD
turned
ADD
grizzled,
ADD
but
ADD
still
ADD
he
ADD
wandered
ADD
on,
ADD
a
ADD
human
ADD
bloodhound,
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
mind
ADD
wholly
ADD
set
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
one
ADD
object
ADD
upon
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
devoted
ADD
his
ADD
life.
ADD
At
ADD
last
ADD
his
ADD
perseverance
ADD
was
ADD
rewarded.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
but
ADD
a
ADD
glance
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
face
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
window,
ADD
but
ADD
that
ADD
one
ADD
glance
ADD
told
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
Cleveland
ADD
in
ADD
Ohio
ADD
possessed
ADD
the
ADD
men
ADD
whom
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
pursuit
ADD
of.
ADD
He
ADD
returned
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
miserable
ADD
lodgings
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
plan
ADD
of
ADD
vengeance
ADD
all
ADD
arranged.
ADD
It
ADD
chanced,
ADD
however,
ADD
that
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
looking
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
window,
ADD
had
ADD
recognized
ADD
the
ADD
vagrant
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
street,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
read
ADD
murder
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
eyes.
ADD
He
ADD
hurried
ADD
before
ADD
a
ADD
justice
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
peace,
ADD
accompanied
ADD
by
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
become
ADD
his
ADD
private
ADD
secretary,
ADD
and
ADD
represented
ADD
to
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
in
ADD
danger
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
lives
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
jealousy
ADD
and
ADD
hatred
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
old
ADD
rival.
ADD
That
ADD
evening
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
was
ADD
taken
ADD
into
ADD
custody,
ADD
and
ADD
not
ADD
being
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
sureties,
ADD
was
ADD
detained
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
weeks.
ADD
When
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
liberated,
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
only
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
that
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
house
ADD
was
ADD
deserted,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
secretary
ADD
had
ADD
departed
ADD
for
ADD
Europe.
ADD

ADD
Again
ADD
the
ADD
avenger
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
foiled,
ADD
and
ADD
again
ADD
his
ADD
concentrated
ADD
hatred
ADD
urged
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
continue
ADD
the
ADD
pursuit.
ADD
Funds
ADD
were
ADD
wanting,
ADD
however,
ADD
and
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
time
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
return
ADD
to
ADD
work,
ADD
saving
ADD
every
ADD
dollar
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
approaching
ADD
journey.
ADD
At
ADD
last,
ADD
having
ADD
collected
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
life
ADD
in
ADD
him,
ADD
he
ADD
departed
ADD
for
ADD
Europe,
ADD
and
ADD
tracked
ADD
his
ADD
enemies
ADD
from
ADD
city
ADD
to
ADD
city,
ADD
working
ADD
his
ADD
way
ADD
in
ADD
any
ADD
menial
ADD
capacity,
ADD
but
ADD
never
ADD
overtaking
ADD
the
ADD
fugitives.
ADD
When
ADD
he
ADD
reached
ADD
St.
ADD
Petersburg
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
departed
ADD
for
ADD
Paris;
ADD
and
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
followed
ADD
them
ADD
there
ADD
he
ADD
learned
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
just
ADD
set
ADD
off
ADD
for
ADD
Copenhagen.
ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
Danish
ADD
capital
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
again
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
days
ADD
late,
ADD
for
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
journeyed
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
London,
ADD
where
ADD
he
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
succeeded
ADD
in
ADD
running
ADD
them
ADD
to
ADD
earth.
ADD
As
ADD
to
ADD
what
ADD
occurred
ADD
there,
ADD
we
ADD
cannot
ADD
do
ADD
better
ADD
than
ADD
quote
ADD
the
ADD
old
ADD
hunter’s
ADD
own
ADD
account,
ADD
as
ADD
duly
ADD
recorded
ADD
in
ADD
Dr.
ADD
Watson’s
ADD
Journal,
ADD
to
ADD
which
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
already
ADD
under
ADD
such
ADD
obligations.

CHAPTER
ADD
VI.
ADD
A
ADD
CONTINUATION
ADD
OF
ADD
THE
ADD
REMINISCENCES
ADD
OF
ADD
JOHN
ADD
WATSON,
ADD
M.D.
ADD

ADD
OUR
ADD
prisoner’s
ADD
furious
ADD
resistance
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
apparently
ADD
indicate
ADD
any
ADD
ferocity
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
disposition
ADD
towards
ADD
ourselves,
ADD
for
ADD
on
ADD
finding
ADD
himself
ADD
powerless,
ADD
he
ADD
smiled
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
affable
ADD
manner,
ADD
and
ADD
expressed
ADD
his
ADD
hopes
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
hurt
ADD
any
ADD
of
ADD
us
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
scuffle.
ADD
“I
ADD
guess
ADD
you’re
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
police-station,”
ADD
he
ADD
remarked
ADD
to
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes.
ADD
“My
ADD
cab’s
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
door.
ADD
If
ADD
you’ll
ADD
loose
ADD
my
ADD
legs
ADD
I’ll
ADD
walk
ADD
down
ADD
to
ADD
it.
ADD
I’m
ADD
not
ADD
so
ADD
light
ADD
to
ADD
lift
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
used
ADD
to
ADD
be.”
ADD

ADD
Gregson
ADD
and
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
exchanged
ADD
glances
ADD
as
ADD
if
ADD
they
ADD
thought
ADD
this
ADD
proposition
ADD
rather
ADD
a
ADD
bold
ADD
one;
ADD
but
ADD
Holmes
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
took
ADD
the
ADD
prisoner
ADD
at
ADD
his
ADD
word,
ADD
and
ADD
loosened
ADD
the
ADD
towel
ADD
which
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
bound
ADD
round
ADD
his
ADD
ancles.
ADD
23
ADD
He
ADD
rose
ADD
and
ADD
stretched
ADD
his
ADD
legs,
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
to
ADD
assure
ADD
himself
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
free
ADD
once
ADD
more.
ADD
I
ADD
remember
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
to
ADD
myself,
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
eyed
ADD
him,
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
seldom
ADD
seen
ADD
a
ADD
more
ADD
powerfully
ADD
built
ADD
man;
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
dark
ADD
sunburned
ADD
face
ADD
bore
ADD
an
ADD
expression
ADD
of
ADD
determination
ADD
and
ADD
energy
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
as
ADD
formidable
ADD
as
ADD
his
ADD
personal
ADD
strength.
ADD

ADD
“If
ADD
there’s
ADD
a
ADD
vacant
ADD
place
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
chief
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
police,
ADD
I
ADD
reckon
ADD
you
ADD
are
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
for
ADD
it,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
gazing
ADD
with
ADD
undisguised
ADD
admiration
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
fellow-lodger.
ADD
“The
ADD
way
ADD
you
ADD
kept
ADD
on
ADD
my
ADD
trail
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
caution.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
had
ADD
better
ADD
come
ADD
with
ADD
me,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
detectives.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
can
ADD
drive
ADD
you,”
ADD
said
ADD
Lestrade.
ADD

ADD
“Good!
ADD
and
ADD
Gregson
ADD
can
ADD
come
ADD
inside
ADD
with
ADD
me.
ADD
You
ADD
too,
ADD
Doctor,
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
taken
ADD
an
ADD
interest
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
and
ADD
may
ADD
as
ADD
well
ADD
stick
ADD
to
ADD
us.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
assented
ADD
gladly,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
all
ADD
descended
ADD
together.
ADD
Our
ADD
prisoner
ADD
made
ADD
no
ADD
attempt
ADD
at
ADD
escape,
ADD
but
ADD
stepped
ADD
calmly
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
cab
ADD
which
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
his,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
followed
ADD
him.
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
mounted
ADD
the
ADD
box,
ADD
whipped
ADD
up
ADD
the
ADD
horse,
ADD
and
ADD
brought
ADD
us
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
short
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
our
ADD
destination.
ADD
We
ADD
were
ADD
ushered
ADD
into
ADD
a
ADD
small
ADD
chamber
ADD
where
ADD
a
ADD
police
ADD
Inspector
ADD
noted
ADD
down
ADD
our
ADD
prisoner’s
ADD
name
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
names
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
men
ADD
with
ADD
whose
ADD
murder
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
charged.
ADD
The
ADD
official
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
white-faced
ADD
unemotional
ADD
man,
ADD
who
ADD
went
ADD
through
ADD
his
ADD
duties
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
dull
ADD
mechanical
ADD
way.
ADD
“The
ADD
prisoner
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
put
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
magistrates
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
course
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
week,”
ADD
he
ADD
said;
ADD
“in
ADD
the
ADD
mean
ADD
time,
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,
ADD
have
ADD
you
ADD
anything
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
wish
ADD
to
ADD
say?
ADD
I
ADD
must
ADD
warn
ADD
you
ADD
that
ADD
your
ADD
words
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
taken
ADD
down,
ADD
and
ADD
may
ADD
be
ADD
used
ADD
against
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
“I’ve
ADD
got
ADD
a
ADD
good
ADD
deal
ADD
to
ADD
say,”
ADD
our
ADD
prisoner
ADD
said
ADD
slowly.
ADD
“I
ADD
want
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
gentlemen
ADD
all
ADD
about
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“Hadn’t
ADD
you
ADD
better
ADD
reserve
ADD
that
ADD
for
ADD
your
ADD
trial?”
ADD
asked
ADD
the
ADD
Inspector.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
may
ADD
never
ADD
be
ADD
tried,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD
“You
ADD
needn’t
ADD
look
ADD
startled.
ADD
It
ADD
isn’t
ADD
suicide
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
thinking
ADD
of.
ADD
Are
ADD
you
ADD
a
ADD
Doctor?”
ADD
He
ADD
turned
ADD
his
ADD
fierce
ADD
dark
ADD
eyes
ADD
upon
ADD
me
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
asked
ADD
this
ADD
last
ADD
question.
ADD

ADD
“Yes;
ADD
I
ADD
am,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“Then
ADD
put
ADD
your
ADD
hand
ADD
here,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
smile,
ADD
motioning
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
manacled
ADD
wrists
ADD
towards
ADD
his
ADD
chest.
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
did
ADD
so;
ADD
and
ADD
became
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
conscious
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
extraordinary
ADD
throbbing
ADD
and
ADD
commotion
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
going
ADD
on
ADD
inside.
ADD
The
ADD
walls
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
chest
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
thrill
ADD
and
ADD
quiver
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
frail
ADD
building
ADD
would
ADD
do
ADD
inside
ADD
when
ADD
some
ADD
powerful
ADD
engine
ADD
was
ADD
at
ADD
work.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
silence
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
room
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
hear
ADD
a
ADD
dull
ADD
humming
ADD
and
ADD
buzzing
ADD
noise
ADD
which
ADD
proceeded
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
source.
ADD

ADD
“Why,”
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
“you
ADD
have
ADD
an
ADD
aortic
ADD
aneurism!”
ADD

ADD
“That’s
ADD
what
ADD
they
ADD
call
ADD
it,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
placidly.
ADD
“I
ADD
went
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
Doctor
ADD
last
ADD
week
ADD
about
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
told
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
bound
ADD
to
ADD
burst
ADD
before
ADD
many
ADD
days
ADD
passed.
ADD
It
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
getting
ADD
worse
ADD
for
ADD
years.
ADD
I
ADD
got
ADD
it
ADD
from
ADD
over-exposure
ADD
and
ADD
under-feeding
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
Mountains.
ADD
I’ve
ADD
done
ADD
my
ADD
work
ADD
now,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
care
ADD
how
ADD
soon
ADD
I
ADD
go,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
like
ADD
to
ADD
leave
ADD
some
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
business
ADD
behind
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
want
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
remembered
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
common
ADD
cut-throat.”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
Inspector
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
detectives
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
hurried
ADD
discussion
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
advisability
ADD
of
ADD
allowing
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
his
ADD
story.
ADD

ADD
“Do
ADD
you
ADD
consider,
ADD
Doctor,
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
immediate
ADD
danger?”
ADD
the
ADD
former
ADD
asked,
ADD
24
ADD

ADD
“Most
ADD
certainly
ADD
there
ADD
is,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“In
ADD
that
ADD
case
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
clearly
ADD
our
ADD
duty,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
interests
ADD
of
ADD
justice,
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
his
ADD
statement,”
ADD
said
ADD
the
ADD
Inspector.
ADD
“You
ADD
are
ADD
at
ADD
liberty,
ADD
sir,
ADD
to
ADD
give
ADD
your
ADD
account,
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
again
ADD
warn
ADD
you
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
taken
ADD
down.”
ADD

ADD
“I’ll
ADD
sit
ADD
down,
ADD
with
ADD
your
ADD
leave,”
ADD
the
ADD
prisoner
ADD
said,
ADD
suiting
ADD
the
ADD
action
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
word.
ADD
“This
ADD
aneurism
ADD
of
ADD
mine
ADD
makes
ADD
me
ADD
easily
ADD
tired,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
tussle
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
half
ADD
an
ADD
hour
ADD
ago
ADD
has
ADD
not
ADD
mended
ADD
matters.
ADD
I’m
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
brink
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
grave,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
not
ADD
likely
ADD
to
ADD
lie
ADD
to
ADD
you.
ADD
Every
ADD
word
ADD
I
ADD
say
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
absolute
ADD
truth,
ADD
and
ADD
how
ADD
you
ADD
use
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
matter
ADD
of
ADD
no
ADD
consequence
ADD
to
ADD
me.”
ADD

ADD
With
ADD
these
ADD
words,
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
leaned
ADD
back
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
chair
ADD
and
ADD
began
ADD
the
ADD
following
ADD
remarkable
ADD
statement.
ADD
He
ADD
spoke
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
calm
ADD
and
ADD
methodical
ADD
manner,
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
the
ADD
events
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
narrated
ADD
were
ADD
commonplace
ADD
enough.
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
vouch
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
accuracy
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
subjoined
ADD
account,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
access
ADD
to
ADD
Lestrade’s
ADD
note-book,
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
the
ADD
prisoner’s
ADD
words
ADD
were
ADD
taken
ADD
down
ADD
exactly
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
uttered.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
don’t
ADD
much
ADD
matter
ADD
to
ADD
you
ADD
why
ADD
I
ADD
hated
ADD
these
ADD
men,”
ADD
he
ADD
said;
ADD
“it’s
ADD
enough
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
guilty
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
two
ADD
human
ADD
beings—a
ADD
father
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
daughter—and
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had,
ADD
therefore,
ADD
forfeited
ADD
their
ADD
own
ADD
lives.
ADD
After
ADD
the
ADD
lapse
ADD
of
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
has
ADD
passed
ADD
since
ADD
their
ADD
crime,
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
impossible
ADD
for
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
secure
ADD
a
ADD
conviction
ADD
against
ADD
them
ADD
in
ADD
any
ADD
court.
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
guilt
ADD
though,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
determined
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
judge,
ADD
jury,
ADD
and
ADD
executioner
ADD
all
ADD
rolled
ADD
into
ADD
one.
ADD
You’d
ADD
have
ADD
done
ADD
the
ADD
same,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
any
ADD
manhood
ADD
in
ADD
you,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
place.
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
girl
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
spoke
ADD
of
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
have
ADD
married
ADD
me
ADD
twenty
ADD
years
ADD
ago.
ADD
She
ADD
was
ADD
forced
ADD
into
ADD
marrying
ADD
that
ADD
same
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
and
ADD
broke
ADD
her
ADD
heart
ADD
over
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
took
ADD
the
ADD
marriage
ADD
ring
ADD
from
ADD
her
ADD
dead
ADD
finger,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
vowed
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
dying
ADD
eyes
ADD
should
ADD
rest
ADD
upon
ADD
that
ADD
very
ADD
ring,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
last
ADD
thoughts
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
crime
ADD
for
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
punished.
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
carried
ADD
it
ADD
about
ADD
with
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
have
ADD
followed
ADD
him
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
accomplice
ADD
over
ADD
two
ADD
continents
ADD
until
ADD
I
ADD
caught
ADD
them.
ADD
They
ADD
thought
ADD
to
ADD
tire
ADD
me
ADD
out,
ADD
but
ADD
they
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
do
ADD
it.
ADD
If
ADD
I
ADD
die
ADD
to-morrow,
ADD
as
ADD
is
ADD
likely
ADD
enough,
ADD
I
ADD
die
ADD
knowing
ADD
that
ADD
my
ADD
work
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
world
ADD
is
ADD
done,
ADD
and
ADD
well
ADD
done.
ADD
They
ADD
have
ADD
perished,
ADD
and
ADD
by
ADD
my
ADD
hand.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
nothing
ADD
left
ADD
for
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
hope
ADD
for,
ADD
or
ADD
to
ADD
desire.
ADD

ADD
“They
ADD
were
ADD
rich
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
poor,
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
easy
ADD
matter
ADD
for
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
follow
ADD
them.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
got
ADD
to
ADD
London
ADD
my
ADD
pocket
ADD
was
ADD
about
ADD
empty,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
must
ADD
turn
ADD
my
ADD
hand
ADD
to
ADD
something
ADD
for
ADD
my
ADD
living.
ADD
Driving
ADD
and
ADD
riding
ADD
are
ADD
as
ADD
natural
ADD
to
ADD
me
ADD
as
ADD
walking,
ADD
so
ADD
I
ADD
applied
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
cabowner’s
ADD
office,
ADD
and
ADD
soon
ADD
got
ADD
employment.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
bring
ADD
a
ADD
certain
ADD
sum
ADD
a
ADD
week
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
owner,
ADD
and
ADD
whatever
ADD
was
ADD
over
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
might
ADD
keep
ADD
for
ADD
myself.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
seldom
ADD
much
ADD
over,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
managed
ADD
to
ADD
scrape
ADD
along
ADD
somehow.
ADD
The
ADD
hardest
ADD
job
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
learn
ADD
my
ADD
way
ADD
about,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
reckon
ADD
that
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
mazes
ADD
that
ADD
ever
ADD
were
ADD
contrived,
ADD
this
ADD
city
ADD
is
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
confusing.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
map
ADD
beside
ADD
me
ADD
though,
ADD
and
ADD
when
ADD
once
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
spotted
ADD
the
ADD
principal
ADD
hotels
ADD
and
ADD
stations,
ADD
I
ADD
got
ADD
on
ADD
pretty
ADD
well.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
was
ADD
some
ADD
time
ADD
before
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
out
ADD
where
ADD
my
ADD
two
ADD
gentlemen
ADD
were
ADD
living;
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
inquired
ADD
and
ADD
inquired
ADD
until
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
I
ADD
dropped
ADD
across
ADD
them.
ADD
They
ADD
were
ADD
at
ADD
a
ADD
boarding-house
ADD
at
ADD
Camberwell,
ADD
over
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
side
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
river.
ADD
When
ADD
once
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
them
ADD
out
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
them
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
mercy.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
grown
ADD
my
ADD
beard,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
chance
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
recognizing
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
would
ADD
dog
ADD
them
ADD
and
ADD
follow
ADD
them
ADD
until
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
my
ADD
opportunity.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
determined
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
should
ADD
not
ADD
escape
ADD
me
ADD
again.
ADD

ADD
“They
ADD
were
ADD
very
ADD
near
ADD
doing
ADD
it
ADD
for
ADD
all
ADD
that.
ADD
Go
ADD
where
ADD
they
ADD
would
ADD
about
ADD
London,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
always
ADD
at
ADD
their
ADD
heels.
ADD
Sometimes
ADD
I
ADD
followed
ADD
them
ADD
on
ADD
my
ADD
cab,
ADD
and
ADD
sometimes
ADD
on
ADD
foot,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
former
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
best,
ADD
for
ADD
then
ADD
they
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
get
ADD
away
ADD
from
ADD
me.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
only
ADD
early
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
morning
ADD
or
ADD
late
ADD
at
ADD
night
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
earn
ADD
anything,
ADD
so
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
began
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
behind
ADD
hand
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
employer.
ADD
I
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
mind
ADD
that,
ADD
however,
ADD
as
ADD
long
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
lay
ADD
my
ADD
hand
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
men
ADD
I
ADD
wanted.
ADD

ADD
“They
ADD
were
ADD
very
ADD
cunning,
ADD
though.
ADD
They
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
thought
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
some
ADD
chance
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
being
ADD
followed,
ADD
for
ADD
they
ADD
would
ADD
never
ADD
go
ADD
out
ADD
alone,
ADD
and
ADD
never
ADD
after
ADD
nightfall.
ADD
During
ADD
two
ADD
weeks
ADD
I
ADD
drove
ADD
behind
ADD
them
ADD
every
ADD
day,
ADD
and
ADD
never
ADD
once
ADD
saw
ADD
them
ADD
separate.
ADD
Drebber
ADD
himself
ADD
was
ADD
drunk
ADD
half
ADD
the
ADD
time,
ADD
but
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
caught
ADD
napping.
ADD
I
ADD
watched
ADD
them
ADD
late
ADD
and
ADD
early,
ADD
but
ADD
never
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
ghost
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
chance;
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
discouraged,
ADD
for
ADD
something
ADD
told
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
hour
ADD
had
ADD
almost
ADD
come.
ADD
My
ADD
only
ADD
fear
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
this
ADD
thing
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
chest
ADD
might
ADD
burst
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
too
ADD
soon
ADD
and
ADD
leave
ADD
my
ADD
work
ADD
undone.
ADD

ADD
“At
ADD
last,
ADD
one
ADD
evening
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
driving
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
down
ADD
Torquay
ADD
Terrace,
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
street
ADD
was
ADD
called
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
they
ADD
boarded,
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
a
ADD
cab
ADD
drive
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
their
ADD
door.
ADD
Presently
ADD
some
ADD
luggage
ADD
was
ADD
brought
ADD
out,
ADD
and
ADD
after
ADD
a
ADD
time
ADD
Drebber
ADD
and
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
followed
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
drove
ADD
off.
ADD
I
ADD
whipped
ADD
up
ADD
my
ADD
horse
ADD
and
ADD
kept
ADD
within
ADD
sight
ADD
of
ADD
them,
ADD
feeling
ADD
very
ADD
ill
ADD
at
ADD
ease,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
feared
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
going
ADD
to
ADD
shift
ADD
their
ADD
quarters.
ADD
At
ADD
Euston
ADD
Station
ADD
they
ADD
got
ADD
out,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
left
ADD
a
ADD
boy
ADD
to
ADD
hold
ADD
my
ADD
horse,
ADD
and
ADD
followed
ADD
them
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
platform.
ADD
I
ADD
heard
ADD
them
ADD
ask
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
Liverpool
ADD
train,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
guard
ADD
answer
ADD
that
ADD
one
ADD
had
ADD
just
ADD
gone
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
would
ADD
not
ADD
be
ADD
another
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
hours.
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
seemed
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
put
ADD
out
ADD
at
ADD
that,
ADD
but
ADD
Drebber
ADD
was
ADD
rather
ADD
pleased
ADD
than
ADD
otherwise.
ADD
I
ADD
got
ADD
so
ADD
close
ADD
to
ADD
them
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
bustle
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
hear
ADD
every
ADD
word
ADD
that
ADD
passed
ADD
between
ADD
them.
ADD
Drebber
ADD
said
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
business
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
own
ADD
to
ADD
do,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
if
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
would
ADD
wait
ADD
for
ADD
him
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
soon
ADD
rejoin
ADD
him.
ADD
His
ADD
companion
ADD
remonstrated
ADD
with
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
reminded
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
resolved
ADD
to
ADD
stick
ADD
together.
ADD
Drebber
ADD
answered
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
matter
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
delicate
ADD
one,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
must
ADD
go
ADD
alone.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
catch
ADD
what
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
said
ADD
to
ADD
that,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
burst
ADD
out
ADD
swearing,
ADD
and
ADD
reminded
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
nothing
ADD
more
ADD
than
ADD
his
ADD
paid
ADD
servant,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
must
ADD
not
ADD
presume
ADD
to
ADD
dictate
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
On
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
Secretary
ADD
gave
ADD
it
ADD
up
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
bad
ADD
job,
ADD
and
ADD
simply
ADD
bargained
ADD
with
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
missed
ADD
the
ADD
last
ADD
train
ADD
he
ADD
should
ADD
rejoin
ADD
him
ADD
at
ADD
Halliday’s
ADD
Private
ADD
Hotel;
ADD
to
ADD
which
ADD
Drebber
ADD
answered
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
back
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
platform
ADD
before
ADD
eleven,
ADD
and
ADD
made
ADD
his
ADD
way
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
station.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
moment
ADD
for
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
waited
ADD
so
ADD
long
ADD
had
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
come.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
my
ADD
enemies
ADD
within
ADD
my
ADD
power.
ADD
Together
ADD
they
ADD
could
ADD
protect
ADD
each
ADD
other,
ADD
but
ADD
singly
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
mercy.
ADD
I
ADD
did
ADD
not
ADD
act,
ADD
however,
ADD
with
ADD
undue
ADD
precipitation.
ADD
My
ADD
plans
ADD
were
ADD
already
ADD
formed.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
satisfaction
ADD
in
ADD
vengeance
ADD
unless
ADD
the
ADD
offender
ADD
has
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
realize
ADD
who
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
that
ADD
strikes
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
why
ADD
retribution
ADD
has
ADD
come
ADD
upon
ADD
him.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
my
ADD
plans
ADD
arranged
ADD
by
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
have
ADD
the
ADD
opportunity
ADD
of
ADD
making
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
wronged
ADD
me
ADD
understand
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
old
ADD
sin
ADD
had
ADD
found
ADD
him
ADD
out.
ADD
It
ADD
chanced
ADD
that
ADD
some
ADD
days
ADD
before
ADD
a
ADD
gentleman
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
engaged
ADD
in
ADD
looking
ADD
over
ADD
some
ADD
houses
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road
ADD
had
ADD
dropped
ADD
the
ADD
key
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
them
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
carriage.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
claimed
ADD
that
ADD
same
ADD
evening,
ADD
and
ADD
returned;
ADD
but
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
interval
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
taken
ADD
a
ADD
moulding
ADD
of
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
duplicate
ADD
constructed.
ADD
By
ADD
means
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
access
ADD
to
ADD
at
ADD
least
ADD
one
ADD
spot
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
great
ADD
city
ADD
where
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
rely
ADD
upon
ADD
being
ADD
free
ADD
from
ADD
interruption.
ADD
How
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
Drebber
ADD
to
ADD
that
ADD
house
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
difficult
ADD
problem
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
now
ADD
to
ADD
solve.
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
walked
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
and
ADD
went
ADD
into
ADD
one
ADD
or
ADD
two
ADD
liquor
ADD
shops,
ADD
staying
ADD
for
ADD
nearly
ADD
half-an-hour
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
last
ADD
of
ADD
them.
ADD
When
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
out
ADD
he
ADD
staggered
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
walk,
ADD
and
ADD
was
ADD
evidently
ADD
pretty
ADD
well
ADD
on.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
hansom
ADD
just
ADD
in
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
hailed
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
followed
ADD
it
ADD
so
ADD
close
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
nose
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
horse
ADD
was
ADD
within
ADD
a
ADD
yard
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
driver
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
way.
ADD
We
ADD
rattled
ADD
across
ADD
Waterloo
ADD
Bridge
ADD
and
ADD
through
ADD
miles
ADD
of
ADD
streets,
ADD
until,
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
astonishment,
ADD
we
ADD
found
ADD
ourselves
ADD
back
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Terrace
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
boarded.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
imagine
ADD
what
ADD
his
ADD
intention
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
returning
ADD
there;
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
on
ADD
and
ADD
pulled
ADD
up
ADD
my
ADD
cab
ADD
a
ADD
hundred
ADD
yards
ADD
or
ADD
so
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
house.
ADD
He
ADD
entered
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
hansom
ADD
drove
ADD
away.
ADD
Give
ADD
me
ADD
a
ADD
glass
ADD
of
ADD
water,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
please.
ADD
My
ADD
mouth
ADD
gets
ADD
dry
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
talking.”
ADD

ADD
I
ADD
handed
ADD
him
ADD
the
ADD
glass,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
drank
ADD
it
ADD
down.
ADD

ADD
“That’s
ADD
better,”
ADD
he
ADD
said.
ADD
“Well,
ADD
I
ADD
waited
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
quarter
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
hour,
ADD
or
ADD
more,
ADD
when
ADD
suddenly
ADD
there
ADD
came
ADD
a
ADD
noise
ADD
like
ADD
people
ADD
struggling
ADD
inside
ADD
the
ADD
house.
ADD
Next
ADD
moment
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
was
ADD
flung
ADD
open
ADD
and
ADD
two
ADD
men
ADD
appeared,
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
whom
ADD
was
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
young
ADD
chap
ADD
whom
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
never
ADD
seen
ADD
before.
ADD
This
ADD
fellow
ADD
had
ADD
Drebber
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
collar,
ADD
and
ADD
when
ADD
they
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
head
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
steps
ADD
he
ADD
gave
ADD
him
ADD
a
ADD
shove
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
kick
ADD
which
ADD
sent
ADD
him
ADD
half
ADD
across
ADD
the
ADD
road.
ADD
‘You
ADD
hound,’
ADD
he
ADD
cried,
ADD
shaking
ADD
his
ADD
stick
ADD
at
ADD
him;
ADD
‘I’ll
ADD
teach
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
insult
ADD
an
ADD
honest
ADD
girl!’
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
hot
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
think
ADD
he
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
thrashed
ADD
Drebber
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
cudgel,
ADD
only
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
cur
ADD
staggered
ADD
away
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
as
ADD
fast
ADD
as
ADD
his
ADD
legs
ADD
would
ADD
carry
ADD
him.
ADD
He
ADD
ran
ADD
as
ADD
far
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
corner,
ADD
and
ADD
then,
ADD
seeing
ADD
my
ADD
cab,
ADD
he
ADD
hailed
ADD
me
ADD
and
ADD
jumped
ADD
in.
ADD
‘Drive
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
Halliday’s
ADD
Private
ADD
Hotel,’
ADD
said
ADD
he.
ADD

ADD
“When
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
him
ADD
fairly
ADD
inside
ADD
my
ADD
cab,
ADD
my
ADD
heart
ADD
jumped
ADD
so
ADD
with
ADD
joy
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
feared
ADD
lest
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
last
ADD
moment
ADD
my
ADD
aneurism
ADD
might
ADD
go
ADD
wrong.
ADD
I
ADD
drove
ADD
along
ADD
slowly,
ADD
weighing
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
mind
ADD
what
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
best
ADD
to
ADD
do.
ADD
I
ADD
might
ADD
take
ADD
him
ADD
right
ADD
out
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
country,
ADD
and
ADD
there
ADD
in
ADD
some
ADD
deserted
ADD
lane
ADD
have
ADD
my
ADD
last
ADD
interview
ADD
with
ADD
him.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
almost
ADD
decided
ADD
upon
ADD
this,
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
solved
ADD
the
ADD
problem
ADD
for
ADD
me.
ADD
The
ADD
craze
ADD
for
ADD
drink
ADD
had
ADD
seized
ADD
him
ADD
again,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
ordered
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
pull
ADD
up
ADD
outside
ADD
a
ADD
gin
ADD
palace.
ADD
He
ADD
went
ADD
in,
ADD
leaving
ADD
word
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
wait
ADD
for
ADD
him.
ADD
There
ADD
he
ADD
remained
ADD
until
ADD
closing
ADD
time,
ADD
and
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
came
ADD
out
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
far
ADD
gone
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
the
ADD
game
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
hands.
ADD

ADD
“Don’t
ADD
imagine
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
intended
ADD
to
ADD
kill
ADD
him
ADD
in
ADD
cold
ADD
blood.
ADD
It
ADD
would
ADD
only
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
rigid
ADD
justice
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
done
ADD
so,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
not
ADD
bring
ADD
myself
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
long
ADD
determined
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
should
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
show
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
life
ADD
if
ADD
he
ADD
chose
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
advantage
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
Among
ADD
the
ADD
many
ADD
billets
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
filled
ADD
in
ADD
America
ADD
during
ADD
my
ADD
wandering
ADD
life,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
once
ADD
janitor
ADD
and
ADD
sweeper
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
laboratory
ADD
at
ADD
York
ADD
College.
ADD
One
ADD
day
ADD
the
ADD
professor
ADD
was
ADD
lecturing
ADD
on
ADD
poisions,
ADD
25
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
showed
ADD
his
ADD
students
ADD
some
ADD
alkaloid,
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
called
ADD
it,
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
extracted
ADD
from
ADD
some
ADD
South
ADD
American
ADD
arrow
ADD
poison,
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
powerful
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
least
ADD
grain
ADD
meant
ADD
instant
ADD
death.
ADD
I
ADD
spotted
ADD
the
ADD
bottle
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
this
ADD
preparation
ADD
was
ADD
kept,
ADD
and
ADD
when
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
all
ADD
gone,
ADD
I
ADD
helped
ADD
myself
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
fairly
ADD
good
ADD
dispenser,
ADD
so
ADD
I
ADD
worked
ADD
this
ADD
alkaloid
ADD
into
ADD
small,
ADD
soluble
ADD
pills,
ADD
and
ADD
each
ADD
pill
ADD
I
ADD
put
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
box
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
similar
ADD
pill
ADD
made
ADD
without
ADD
the
ADD
poison.
ADD
I
ADD
determined
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
that
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
my
ADD
chance,
ADD
my
ADD
gentlemen
ADD
should
ADD
each
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
draw
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
one
ADD
of
ADD
these
ADD
boxes,
ADD
while
ADD
I
ADD
ate
ADD
the
ADD
pill
ADD
that
ADD
remained.
ADD
It
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
quite
ADD
as
ADD
deadly,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
good
ADD
deal
ADD
less
ADD
noisy
ADD
than
ADD
firing
ADD
across
ADD
a
ADD
handkerchief.
ADD
From
ADD
that
ADD
day
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
always
ADD
my
ADD
pill
ADD
boxes
ADD
about
ADD
with
ADD
me,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
had
ADD
now
ADD
come
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
use
ADD
them.
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
was
ADD
nearer
ADD
one
ADD
than
ADD
twelve,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
wild,
ADD
bleak
ADD
night,
ADD
blowing
ADD
hard
ADD
and
ADD
raining
ADD
in
ADD
torrents.
ADD
Dismal
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
outside,
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
glad
ADD
within—so
ADD
glad
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
have
ADD
shouted
ADD
out
ADD
from
ADD
pure
ADD
exultation.
ADD
If
ADD
any
ADD
of
ADD
you
ADD
gentlemen
ADD
have
ADD
ever
ADD
pined
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
thing,
ADD
and
ADD
longed
ADD
for
ADD
it
ADD
during
ADD
twenty
ADD
long
ADD
years,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
suddenly
ADD
found
ADD
it
ADD
within
ADD
your
ADD
reach,
ADD
you
ADD
would
ADD
understand
ADD
my
ADD
feelings.
ADD
I
ADD
lit
ADD
a
ADD
cigar,
ADD
and
ADD
puffed
ADD
at
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
steady
ADD
my
ADD
nerves,
ADD
but
ADD
my
ADD
hands
ADD
were
ADD
trembling,
ADD
and
ADD
my
ADD
temples
ADD
throbbing
ADD
with
ADD
excitement.
ADD
As
ADD
I
ADD
drove,
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
old
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
and
ADD
sweet
ADD
Lucy
ADD
looking
ADD
at
ADD
me
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
darkness
ADD
and
ADD
smiling
ADD
at
ADD
me,
ADD
just
ADD
as
ADD
plain
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
see
ADD
you
ADD
all
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
room.
ADD
All
ADD
the
ADD
way
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
ahead
ADD
of
ADD
me,
ADD
one
ADD
on
ADD
each
ADD
side
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
horse
ADD
until
ADD
I
ADD
pulled
ADD
up
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
Brixton
ADD
Road.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
soul
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
seen,
ADD
nor
ADD
a
ADD
sound
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
heard,
ADD
except
ADD
the
ADD
dripping
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
rain.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
looked
ADD
in
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
window,
ADD
I
ADD
found
ADD
Drebber
ADD
all
ADD
huddled
ADD
together
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
drunken
ADD
sleep.
ADD
I
ADD
shook
ADD
him
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
arm,
ADD
‘It’s
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
out,’
ADD
I
ADD
said.
ADD

ADD
“‘All
ADD
right,
ADD
cabby,’
ADD
said
ADD
he.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
suppose
ADD
he
ADD
thought
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
hotel
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
mentioned,
ADD
for
ADD
he
ADD
got
ADD
out
ADD
without
ADD
another
ADD
word,
ADD
and
ADD
followed
ADD
me
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
garden.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
walk
ADD
beside
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
him
ADD
steady,
ADD
for
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
top-heavy.
ADD
When
ADD
we
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
I
ADD
opened
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
led
ADD
him
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
front
ADD
room.
ADD
I
ADD
give
ADD
you
ADD
my
ADD
word
ADD
that
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
way,
ADD
the
ADD
father
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
daughter
ADD
were
ADD
walking
ADD
in
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
us.
ADD

ADD
“‘It’s
ADD
infernally
ADD
dark,’
ADD
said
ADD
he,
ADD
stamping
ADD
about.
ADD

ADD
“‘We’ll
ADD
soon
ADD
have
ADD
a
ADD
light,’
ADD
I
ADD
said,
ADD
striking
ADD
a
ADD
match
ADD
and
ADD
putting
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
a
ADD
wax
ADD
candle
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
brought
ADD
with
ADD
me.
ADD
‘Now,
ADD
Enoch
ADD
Drebber,’
ADD
I
ADD
continued,
ADD
turning
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
holding
ADD
the
ADD
light
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
face,
ADD
‘who
ADD
am
ADD
I?’
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
gazed
ADD
at
ADD
me
ADD
with
ADD
bleared,
ADD
drunken
ADD
eyes
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
moment,
ADD
and
ADD
then
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
a
ADD
horror
ADD
spring
ADD
up
ADD
in
ADD
them,
ADD
and
ADD
convulse
ADD
his
ADD
whole
ADD
features,
ADD
which
ADD
showed
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
knew
ADD
me.
ADD
He
ADD
staggered
ADD
back
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
livid
ADD
face,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
perspiration
ADD
break
ADD
out
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
brow,
ADD
while
ADD
his
ADD
teeth
ADD
chattered
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
head.
ADD
At
ADD
the
ADD
sight,
ADD
I
ADD
leaned
ADD
my
ADD
back
ADD
against
ADD
the
ADD
door
ADD
and
ADD
laughed
ADD
loud
ADD
and
ADD
long.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
always
ADD
known
ADD
that
ADD
vengeance
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
sweet,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
never
ADD
hoped
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
contentment
ADD
of
ADD
soul
ADD
which
ADD
now
ADD
possessed
ADD
me.
ADD

ADD
“‘You
ADD
dog!’
ADD
I
ADD
said;
ADD
‘I
ADD
have
ADD
hunted
ADD
you
ADD
from
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City
ADD
to
ADD
St.
ADD
Petersburg,
ADD
and
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
always
ADD
escaped
ADD
me.
ADD
Now,
ADD
at
ADD
last
ADD
your
ADD
wanderings
ADD
have
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
an
ADD
end,
ADD
for
ADD
either
ADD
you
ADD
or
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
never
ADD
see
ADD
to-morrow’s
ADD
sun
ADD
rise.’
ADD
He
ADD
shrunk
ADD
still
ADD
further
ADD
away
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
spoke,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
see
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
thought
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
mad.
ADD
So
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
time.
ADD
The
ADD
pulses
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
temples
ADD
beat
ADD
like
ADD
sledge-hammers,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
believe
ADD
I
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
fit
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
sort
ADD
if
ADD
the
ADD
blood
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
gushed
ADD
from
ADD
my
ADD
nose
ADD
and
ADD
relieved
ADD
me.
ADD

ADD
“‘What
ADD
do
ADD
you
ADD
think
ADD
of
ADD
Lucy
ADD
Ferrier
ADD
now?’
ADD
I
ADD
cried,
ADD
locking
ADD
the
ADD
door,
ADD
and
ADD
shaking
ADD
the
ADD
key
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
face.
ADD
‘Punishment
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
slow
ADD
in
ADD
coming,
ADD
but
ADD
it
ADD
has
ADD
overtaken
ADD
you
ADD
at
ADD
last.’
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
his
ADD
coward
ADD
lips
ADD
tremble
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
spoke.
ADD
He
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
begged
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
life,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
knew
ADD
well
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
useless.
ADD

ADD
“‘Would
ADD
you
ADD
murder
ADD
me?’
ADD
he
ADD
stammered.
ADD

ADD
“‘There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
murder,’
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD
‘Who
ADD
talks
ADD
of
ADD
murdering
ADD
a
ADD
mad
ADD
dog?
ADD
What
ADD
mercy
ADD
had
ADD
you
ADD
upon
ADD
my
ADD
poor
ADD
darling,
ADD
when
ADD
you
ADD
dragged
ADD
her
ADD
from
ADD
her
ADD
slaughtered
ADD
father,
ADD
and
ADD
bore
ADD
her
ADD
away
ADD
to
ADD
your
ADD
accursed
ADD
and
ADD
shameless
ADD
harem.’
ADD

ADD
“‘It
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
I
ADD
who
ADD
killed
ADD
her
ADD
father,’
ADD
he
ADD
cried.
ADD

ADD
“‘But
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
you
ADD
who
ADD
broke
ADD
her
ADD
innocent
ADD
heart,’
ADD
I
ADD
shrieked,
ADD
thrusting
ADD
the
ADD
box
ADD
before
ADD
him.
ADD
‘Let
ADD
the
ADD
high
ADD
God
ADD
judge
ADD
between
ADD
us.
ADD
Choose
ADD
and
ADD
eat.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
death
ADD
in
ADD
one
ADD
and
ADD
life
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
other.
ADD
I
ADD
shall
ADD
take
ADD
what
ADD
you
ADD
leave.
ADD
Let
ADD
us
ADD
see
ADD
if
ADD
there
ADD
is
ADD
justice
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
earth,
ADD
or
ADD
if
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
ruled
ADD
by
ADD
chance.’
ADD

ADD
“He
ADD
cowered
ADD
away
ADD
with
ADD
wild
ADD
cries
ADD
and
ADD
prayers
ADD
for
ADD
mercy,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
drew
ADD
my
ADD
knife
ADD
and
ADD
held
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
throat
ADD
until
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
obeyed
ADD
me.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
swallowed
ADD
the
ADD
other,
ADD
and
ADD
we
ADD
stood
ADD
facing
ADD
one
ADD
another
ADD
in
ADD
silence
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
minute
ADD
or
ADD
more,
ADD
waiting
ADD
to
ADD
see
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
live
ADD
and
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
die.
ADD
Shall
ADD
I
ADD
ever
ADD
forget
ADD
the
ADD
look
ADD
which
ADD
came
ADD
over
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
warning
ADD
pangs
ADD
told
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
poison
ADD
was
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
system?
ADD
I
ADD
laughed
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
held
ADD
Lucy’s
ADD
marriage
ADD
ring
ADD
in
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
eyes.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
but
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
moment,
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
action
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
alkaloid
ADD
is
ADD
rapid.
ADD
A
ADD
spasm
ADD
of
ADD
pain
ADD
contorted
ADD
his
ADD
features;
ADD
he
ADD
threw
ADD
his
ADD
hands
ADD
out
ADD
in
ADD
front
ADD
of
ADD
him,
ADD
staggered,
ADD
and
ADD
then,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
hoarse
ADD
cry,
ADD
fell
ADD
heavily
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
floor.
ADD
I
ADD
turned
ADD
him
ADD
over
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
foot,
ADD
and
ADD
placed
ADD
my
ADD
hand
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
heart.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
movement.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
dead!
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
blood
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
streaming
ADD
from
ADD
my
ADD
nose,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
taken
ADD
no
ADD
notice
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
know
ADD
what
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
that
ADD
put
ADD
it
ADD
into
ADD
my
ADD
head
ADD
to
ADD
write
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wall
ADD
with
ADD
it.
ADD
Perhaps
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
some
ADD
mischievous
ADD
idea
ADD
of
ADD
setting
ADD
the
ADD
police
ADD
upon
ADD
a
ADD
wrong
ADD
track,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
felt
ADD
light-hearted
ADD
and
ADD
cheerful.
ADD
I
ADD
remembered
ADD
a
ADD
German
ADD
being
ADD
found
ADD
in
ADD
New
ADD
York
ADD
with
ADD
RACHE
ADD
written
ADD
up
ADD
above
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
argued
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
time
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
newspapers
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
secret
ADD
societies
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
done
ADD
it.
ADD
I
ADD
guessed
ADD
that
ADD
what
ADD
puzzled
ADD
the
ADD
New
ADD
Yorkers
ADD
would
ADD
puzzle
ADD
the
ADD
Londoners,
ADD
so
ADD
I
ADD
dipped
ADD
my
ADD
finger
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
blood
ADD
and
ADD
printed
ADD
it
ADD
on
ADD
a
ADD
convenient
ADD
place
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
wall.
ADD
Then
ADD
I
ADD
walked
ADD
down
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
cab
ADD
and
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
nobody
ADD
about,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
night
ADD
was
ADD
still
ADD
very
ADD
wild.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
driven
ADD
some
ADD
distance
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
put
ADD
my
ADD
hand
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
pocket
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
usually
ADD
kept
ADD
Lucy’s
ADD
ring,
ADD
and
ADD
found
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
not
ADD
there.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
thunderstruck
ADD
at
ADD
this,
ADD
for
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
only
ADD
memento
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
of
ADD
her.
ADD
Thinking
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
might
ADD
have
ADD
dropped
ADD
it
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
stooped
ADD
over
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
body,
ADD
I
ADD
drove
ADD
back,
ADD
and
ADD
leaving
ADD
my
ADD
cab
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
side
ADD
street,
ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
boldly
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
house—for
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
ready
ADD
to
ADD
dare
ADD
anything
ADD
rather
ADD
than
ADD
lose
ADD
the
ADD
ring.
ADD
When
ADD
I
ADD
arrived
ADD
there,
ADD
I
ADD
walked
ADD
right
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
arms
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
police-officer
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
coming
ADD
out,
ADD
and
ADD
only
ADD
managed
ADD
to
ADD
disarm
ADD
his
ADD
suspicions
ADD
by
ADD
pretending
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
hopelessly
ADD
drunk.
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
was
ADD
how
ADD
Enoch
ADD
Drebber
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
end.
ADD
All
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
then
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
as
ADD
much
ADD
for
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
pay
ADD
off
ADD
John
ADD
Ferrier’s
ADD
debt.
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
staying
ADD
at
ADD
Halliday’s
ADD
Private
ADD
Hotel,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
hung
ADD
about
ADD
all
ADD
day,
ADD
but
ADD
he
ADD
never
ADD
came
ADD
out.
ADD
26
ADD
fancy
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
suspected
ADD
something
ADD
when
ADD
Drebber
ADD
failed
ADD
to
ADD
put
ADD
in
ADD
an
ADD
appearance.
ADD
He
ADD
was
ADD
cunning,
ADD
was
ADD
Stangerson,
ADD
and
ADD
always
ADD
on
ADD
his
ADD
guard.
ADD
If
ADD
he
ADD
thought
ADD
he
ADD
could
ADD
keep
ADD
me
ADD
off
ADD
by
ADD
staying
ADD
indoors
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
very
ADD
much
ADD
mistaken.
ADD
I
ADD
soon
ADD
found
ADD
out
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
window
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
bedroom,
ADD
and
ADD
early
ADD
next
ADD
morning
ADD
I
ADD
took
ADD
advantage
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
ladders
ADD
which
ADD
were
ADD
lying
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
lane
ADD
behind
ADD
the
ADD
hotel,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
made
ADD
my
ADD
way
ADD
into
ADD
his
ADD
room
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
grey
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
dawn.
ADD
I
ADD
woke
ADD
him
ADD
up
ADD
and
ADD
told
ADD
him
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
hour
ADD
had
ADD
come
ADD
when
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
answer
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
life
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
taken
ADD
so
ADD
long
ADD
before.
ADD
I
ADD
described
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
death
ADD
to
ADD
him,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
gave
ADD
him
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
choice
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
poisoned
ADD
pills.
ADD
Instead
ADD
of
ADD
grasping
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
chance
ADD
of
ADD
safety
ADD
which
ADD
that
ADD
offered
ADD
him,
ADD
he
ADD
sprang
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
bed
ADD
and
ADD
flew
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
throat.
ADD
In
ADD
self-defence
ADD
I
ADD
stabbed
ADD
him
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
heart.
ADD
It
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
the
ADD
same
ADD
in
ADD
any
ADD
case,
ADD
for
ADD
Providence
ADD
would
ADD
never
ADD
have
ADD
allowed
ADD
his
ADD
guilty
ADD
hand
ADD
to
ADD
pick
ADD
out
ADD
anything
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
poison.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
little
ADD
more
ADD
to
ADD
say,
ADD
and
ADD
it’s
ADD
as
ADD
well,
ADD
for
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
about
ADD
done
ADD
up.
ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
on
ADD
cabbing
ADD
it
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
day
ADD
or
ADD
so,
ADD
intending
ADD
to
ADD
keep
ADD
at
ADD
it
ADD
until
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
save
ADD
enough
ADD
to
ADD
take
ADD
me
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
America.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
standing
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
yard
ADD
when
ADD
a
ADD
ragged
ADD
youngster
ADD
asked
ADD
if
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
cabby
ADD
there
ADD
called
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,
ADD
and
ADD
said
ADD
that
ADD
his
ADD
cab
ADD
was
ADD
wanted
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
gentleman
ADD
at
ADD
221B,
ADD
Baker
ADD
Street.
ADD
I
ADD
went
ADD
round,
ADD
suspecting
ADD
no
ADD
harm,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
next
ADD
thing
ADD
I
ADD
knew,
ADD
this
ADD
young
ADD
man
ADD
here
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
bracelets
ADD
on
ADD
my
ADD
wrists,
ADD
and
ADD
as
ADD
neatly
ADD
snackled
ADD
27
ADD
as
ADD
ever
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
life.
ADD
That’s
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
of
ADD
my
ADD
story,
ADD
gentlemen.
ADD
You
ADD
may
ADD
consider
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
murderer;
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
hold
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
am
ADD
just
ADD
as
ADD
much
ADD
an
ADD
officer
ADD
of
ADD
justice
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
are.”
ADD

ADD
So
ADD
thrilling
ADD
had
ADD
the
ADD
man’s
ADD
narrative
ADD
been,
ADD
and
ADD
his
ADD
manner
ADD
was
ADD
so
ADD
impressive
ADD
that
ADD
we
ADD
had
ADD
sat
ADD
silent
ADD
and
ADD
absorbed.
ADD
Even
ADD
the
ADD
professional
ADD
detectives,
ADD
blasé
ADD
as
ADD
they
ADD
were
ADD
in
ADD
every
ADD
detail
ADD
of
ADD
crime,
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
keenly
ADD
interested
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
man’s
ADD
story.
ADD
When
ADD
he
ADD
finished
ADD
we
ADD
sat
ADD
for
ADD
some
ADD
minutes
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
stillness
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
only
ADD
broken
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
scratching
ADD
of
ADD
Lestrade’s
ADD
pencil
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
gave
ADD
the
ADD
finishing
ADD
touches
ADD
to
ADD
his
ADD
shorthand
ADD
account.
ADD

ADD
“There
ADD
is
ADD
only
ADD
one
ADD
point
ADD
on
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
should
ADD
like
ADD
a
ADD
little
ADD
more
ADD
information,”
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
said
ADD
at
ADD
last.
ADD
“Who
ADD
was
ADD
your
ADD
accomplice
ADD
who
ADD
came
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
ring
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
advertised?”
ADD

ADD
The
ADD
prisoner
ADD
winked
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
friend
ADD
jocosely.
ADD
“I
ADD
can
ADD
tell
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
secrets,”
ADD
he
ADD
said,
ADD
“but
ADD
I
ADD
don’t
ADD
get
ADD
other
ADD
people
ADD
into
ADD
trouble.
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
your
ADD
advertisement,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
thought
ADD
it
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
plant,
ADD
or
ADD
it
ADD
might
ADD
be
ADD
the
ADD
ring
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
wanted.
ADD
My
ADD
friend
ADD
volunteered
ADD
to
ADD
go
ADD
and
ADD
see.
ADD
I
ADD
think
ADD
you’ll
ADD
own
ADD
he
ADD
did
ADD
it
ADD
smartly.”
ADD

ADD
“Not
ADD
a
ADD
doubt
ADD
of
ADD
that,”
ADD
said
ADD
Holmes
ADD
heartily.
ADD

ADD
“Now,
ADD
gentlemen,”
ADD
the
ADD
Inspector
ADD
remarked
ADD
gravely,
ADD
“the
ADD
forms
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
law
ADD
must
ADD
be
ADD
complied
ADD
with.
ADD
On
ADD
Thursday
ADD
the
ADD
prisoner
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
brought
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
magistrates,
ADD
and
ADD
your
ADD
attendance
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
required.
ADD
Until
ADD
then
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
responsible
ADD
for
ADD
him.”
ADD
He
ADD
rang
ADD
the
ADD
bell
ADD
as
ADD
he
ADD
spoke,
ADD
and
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
was
ADD
led
ADD
off
ADD
by
ADD
a
ADD
couple
ADD
of
ADD
warders,
ADD
while
ADD
my
ADD
friend
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
made
ADD
our
ADD
way
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Station
ADD
and
ADD
took
ADD
a
ADD
cab
ADD
back
ADD
to
ADD
Baker
ADD
Street.

ADD

ADD
CHAPTER
ADD
VII.
ADD
THE
ADD
CONCLUSION.
ADD

ADD
WE
ADD
had
ADD
all
ADD
been
ADD
warned
ADD
to
ADD
appear
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
magistrates
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
Thursday;
ADD
but
ADD
when
ADD
the
ADD
Thursday
ADD
came
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
occasion
ADD
for
ADD
our
ADD
testimony.
ADD
A
ADD
higher
ADD
Judge
ADD
had
ADD
taken
ADD
the
ADD
matter
ADD
in
ADD
hand,
ADD
and
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
summoned
ADD
before
ADD
a
ADD
tribunal
ADD
where
ADD
strict
ADD
justice
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
meted
ADD
out
ADD
to
ADD
him.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
night
ADD
after
ADD
his
ADD
capture
ADD
the
ADD
aneurism
ADD
burst,
ADD
and
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
found
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
morning
ADD
stretched
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
floor
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
cell,
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
placid
ADD
smile
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
face,
ADD
as
ADD
though
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
able
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
dying
ADD
moments
ADD
to
ADD
look
ADD
back
ADD
upon
ADD
a
ADD
useful
ADD
life,
ADD
and
ADD
on
ADD
work
ADD
well
ADD
done.
ADD

ADD
“Gregson
ADD
and
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
wild
ADD
about
ADD
his
ADD
death,”
ADD
Holmes
ADD
remarked,
ADD
as
ADD
we
ADD
chatted
ADD
it
ADD
over
ADD
next
ADD
evening.
ADD
“Where
ADD
will
ADD
their
ADD
grand
ADD
advertisement
ADD
be
ADD
now?”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
don’t
ADD
see
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
very
ADD
much
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
with
ADD
his
ADD
capture,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered.
ADD

ADD
“What
ADD
you
ADD
do
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
world
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
matter
ADD
of
ADD
no
ADD
consequence,”
ADD
returned
ADD
my
ADD
companion,
ADD
bitterly.
ADD
“The
ADD
question
ADD
is,
ADD
what
ADD
can
ADD
you
ADD
make
ADD
people
ADD
believe
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
have
ADD
done.
ADD
Never
ADD
mind,”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
more
ADD
brightly,
ADD
after
ADD
a
ADD
pause.
ADD
“I
ADD
would
ADD
not
ADD
have
ADD
missed
ADD
the
ADD
investigation
ADD
for
ADD
anything.
ADD
There
ADD
has
ADD
been
ADD
no
ADD
better
ADD
case
ADD
within
ADD
my
ADD
recollection.
ADD
Simple
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
was,
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
several
ADD
most
ADD
instructive
ADD
points
ADD
about
ADD
it.”
ADD

ADD
“Simple!”
ADD
I
ADD
ejaculated.
ADD

ADD
“Well,
ADD
really,
ADD
it
ADD
can
ADD
hardly
ADD
be
ADD
described
ADD
as
ADD
otherwise,”
ADD
said
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
smiling
ADD
at
ADD
my
ADD
surprise.
ADD
“The
ADD
proof
ADD
of
ADD
its
ADD
intrinsic
ADD
simplicity
ADD
is,
ADD
that
ADD
without
ADD
any
ADD
help
ADD
save
ADD
a
ADD
few
ADD
very
ADD
ordinary
ADD
deductions
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
lay
ADD
my
ADD
hand
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
criminal
ADD
within
ADD
three
ADD
days.”
ADD

ADD
“That
ADD
is
ADD
true,”
ADD
said
ADD
I.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
already
ADD
explained
ADD
to
ADD
you
ADD
that
ADD
what
ADD
is
ADD
out
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
common
ADD
is
ADD
usually
ADD
a
ADD
guide
ADD
rather
ADD
than
ADD
a
ADD
hindrance.
ADD
In
ADD
solving
ADD
a
ADD
problem
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
sort,
ADD
the
ADD
grand
ADD
thing
ADD
is
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
reason
ADD
backwards.
ADD
That
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
useful
ADD
accomplishment,
ADD
and
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
easy
ADD
one,
ADD
but
ADD
people
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
practise
ADD
it
ADD
much.
ADD
In
ADD
the
ADD
every-day
ADD
affairs
ADD
of
ADD
life
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
more
ADD
useful
ADD
to
ADD
reason
ADD
forwards,
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
comes
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
neglected.
ADD
There
ADD
are
ADD
fifty
ADD
who
ADD
can
ADD
reason
ADD
synthetically
ADD
for
ADD
one
ADD
who
ADD
can
ADD
reason
ADD
analytically.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
confess,”
ADD
said
ADD
I,
ADD
“that
ADD
I
ADD
do
ADD
not
ADD
quite
ADD
follow
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
hardly
ADD
expected
ADD
that
ADD
you
ADD
would.
ADD
Let
ADD
me
ADD
see
ADD
if
ADD
I
ADD
can
ADD
make
ADD
it
ADD
clearer.
ADD
Most
ADD
people,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
describe
ADD
a
ADD
train
ADD
of
ADD
events
ADD
to
ADD
them,
ADD
will
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
what
ADD
the
ADD
result
ADD
would
ADD
be.
ADD
They
ADD
can
ADD
put
ADD
those
ADD
events
ADD
together
ADD
in
ADD
their
ADD
minds,
ADD
and
ADD
argue
ADD
from
ADD
them
ADD
that
ADD
something
ADD
will
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
pass.
ADD
There
ADD
are
ADD
few
ADD
people,
ADD
however,
ADD
who,
ADD
if
ADD
you
ADD
told
ADD
them
ADD
a
ADD
result,
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
able
ADD
to
ADD
evolve
ADD
from
ADD
their
ADD
own
ADD
inner
ADD
consciousness
ADD
what
ADD
the
ADD
steps
ADD
were
ADD
which
ADD
led
ADD
up
ADD
to
ADD
that
ADD
result.
ADD
This
ADD
power
ADD
is
ADD
what
ADD
I
ADD
mean
ADD
when
ADD
I
ADD
talk
ADD
of
ADD
reasoning
ADD
backwards,
ADD
or
ADD
analytically.”
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
understand,”
ADD
said
ADD
I.
ADD

ADD
“Now
ADD
this
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
case
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
you
ADD
were
ADD
given
ADD
the
ADD
result
ADD
and
ADD
had
ADD
to
ADD
find
ADD
everything
ADD
else
ADD
for
ADD
yourself.
ADD
Now
ADD
let
ADD
me
ADD
endeavour
ADD
to
ADD
show
ADD
you
ADD
the
ADD
different
ADD
steps
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
reasoning.
ADD
To
ADD
begin
ADD
at
ADD
the
ADD
beginning.
ADD
I
ADD
approached
ADD
the
ADD
house,
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
know,
ADD
on
ADD
foot,
ADD
and
ADD
with
ADD
my
ADD
mind
ADD
entirely
ADD
free
ADD
from
ADD
all
ADD
impressions.
ADD
I
ADD
naturally
ADD
began
ADD
by
ADD
examining
ADD
the
ADD
roadway,
ADD
and
ADD
there,
ADD
as
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
already
ADD
explained
ADD
to
ADD
you,
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
clearly
ADD
the
ADD
marks
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
cab,
ADD
which,
ADD
I
ADD
ascertained
ADD
by
ADD
inquiry,
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
there
ADD
during
ADD
the
ADD
night.
ADD
I
ADD
satisfied
ADD
myself
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
cab
ADD
and
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
private
ADD
carriage
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
narrow
ADD
gauge
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
wheels.
ADD
The
ADD
ordinary
ADD
London
ADD
growler
ADD
is
ADD
considerably
ADD
less
ADD
wide
ADD
than
ADD
a
ADD
gentleman’s
ADD
brougham.
ADD

ADD
“This
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
point
ADD
gained.
ADD
I
ADD
then
ADD
walked
ADD
slowly
ADD
down
ADD
the
ADD
garden
ADD
path,
ADD
which
ADD
happened
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
composed
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
clay
ADD
soil,
ADD
peculiarly
ADD
suitable
ADD
for
ADD
taking
ADD
impressions.
ADD
No
ADD
doubt
ADD
it
ADD
appeared
ADD
to
ADD
you
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
a
ADD
mere
ADD
trampled
ADD
line
ADD
of
ADD
slush,
ADD
but
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
trained
ADD
eyes
ADD
every
ADD
mark
ADD
upon
ADD
its
ADD
surface
ADD
had
ADD
a
ADD
meaning.
ADD
There
ADD
is
ADD
no
ADD
branch
ADD
of
ADD
detective
ADD
science
ADD
which
ADD
is
ADD
so
ADD
important
ADD
and
ADD
so
ADD
much
ADD
neglected
ADD
as
ADD
the
ADD
art
ADD
of
ADD
tracing
ADD
footsteps.
ADD
Happily,
ADD
I
ADD
have
ADD
always
ADD
laid
ADD
great
ADD
stress
ADD
upon
ADD
it,
ADD
and
ADD
much
ADD
practice
ADD
has
ADD
made
ADD
it
ADD
second
ADD
nature
ADD
to
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
the
ADD
heavy
ADD
footmarks
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
constables,
ADD
but
ADD
I
ADD
saw
ADD
also
ADD
the
ADD
track
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
men
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
first
ADD
passed
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
garden.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
easy
ADD
to
ADD
tell
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
before
ADD
the
ADD
others,
ADD
because
ADD
in
ADD
places
ADD
their
ADD
marks
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
entirely
ADD
obliterated
ADD
by
ADD
the
ADD
others
ADD
coming
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
top
ADD
of
ADD
them.
ADD
In
ADD
this
ADD
way
ADD
my
ADD
second
ADD
link
ADD
was
ADD
formed,
ADD
which
ADD
told
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
nocturnal
ADD
visitors
ADD
were
ADD
two
ADD
in
ADD
number,
ADD
one
ADD
remarkable
ADD
for
ADD
his
ADD
height
ADD
(as
ADD
I
ADD
calculated
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
length
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
stride),
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
other
ADD
fashionably
ADD
dressed,
ADD
to
ADD
judge
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
small
ADD
and
ADD
elegant
ADD
impression
ADD
left
ADD
by
ADD
his
ADD
boots.
ADD

ADD
“On
ADD
entering
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
this
ADD
last
ADD
inference
ADD
was
ADD
confirmed.
ADD
My
ADD
well-booted
ADD
man
ADD
lay
ADD
before
ADD
me.
ADD
The
ADD
tall
ADD
one,
ADD
then,
ADD
had
ADD
done
ADD
the
ADD
murder,
ADD
if
ADD
murder
ADD
there
ADD
was.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
wound
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
dead
ADD
man’s
ADD
person,
ADD
but
ADD
the
ADD
agitated
ADD
expression
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
face
ADD
assured
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
foreseen
ADD
his
ADD
fate
ADD
before
ADD
it
ADD
came
ADD
upon
ADD
him.
ADD
Men
ADD
who
ADD
die
ADD
from
ADD
heart
ADD
disease,
ADD
or
ADD
any
ADD
sudden
ADD
natural
ADD
cause,
ADD
never
ADD
by
ADD
any
ADD
chance
ADD
exhibit
ADD
agitation
ADD
upon
ADD
their
ADD
features.
ADD
Having
ADD
sniffed
ADD
the
ADD
dead
ADD
man’s
ADD
lips
ADD
I
ADD
detected
ADD
a
ADD
slightly
ADD
sour
ADD
smell,
ADD
and
ADD
I
ADD
came
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
conclusion
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
had
ADD
poison
ADD
forced
ADD
upon
ADD
him.
ADD
Again,
ADD
I
ADD
argued
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
forced
ADD
upon
ADD
him
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
hatred
ADD
and
ADD
fear
ADD
expressed
ADD
upon
ADD
his
ADD
face.
ADD
By
ADD
the
ADD
method
ADD
of
ADD
exclusion,
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
arrived
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
result,
ADD
for
ADD
no
ADD
other
ADD
hypothesis
ADD
would
ADD
meet
ADD
the
ADD
facts.
ADD
Do
ADD
not
ADD
imagine
ADD
that
ADD
it
ADD
was
ADD
a
ADD
very
ADD
unheard
ADD
of
ADD
idea.
ADD
The
ADD
forcible
ADD
administration
ADD
of
ADD
poison
ADD
is
ADD
by
ADD
no
ADD
means
ADD
a
ADD
new
ADD
thing
ADD
in
ADD
criminal
ADD
annals.
ADD
The
ADD
cases
ADD
of
ADD
Dolsky
ADD
in
ADD
Odessa,
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
Leturier
ADD
in
ADD
Montpellier,
ADD
will
ADD
occur
ADD
at
ADD
once
ADD
to
ADD
any
ADD
toxicologist.
ADD

ADD
“And
ADD
now
ADD
came
ADD
the
ADD
great
ADD
question
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
reason
ADD
why.
ADD
Robbery
ADD
had
ADD
not
ADD
been
ADD
the
ADD
object
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
murder,
ADD
for
ADD
nothing
ADD
was
ADD
taken.
ADD
Was
ADD
it
ADD
politics,
ADD
then,
ADD
or
ADD
was
ADD
it
ADD
a
ADD
woman?
ADD
That
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
question
ADD
which
ADD
confronted
ADD
me.
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
inclined
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
first
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
latter
ADD
supposition.
ADD
Political
ADD
assassins
ADD
are
ADD
only
ADD
too
ADD
glad
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
their
ADD
work
ADD
and
ADD
to
ADD
fly.
ADD
This
ADD
murder
ADD
had,
ADD
on
ADD
the
ADD
contrary,
ADD
been
ADD
done
ADD
most
ADD
deliberately,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
perpetrator
ADD
had
ADD
left
ADD
his
ADD
tracks
ADD
all
ADD
over
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
showing
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
there
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
time.
ADD
It
ADD
must
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
a
ADD
private
ADD
wrong,
ADD
and
ADD
not
ADD
a
ADD
political
ADD
one,
ADD
which
ADD
called
ADD
for
ADD
such
ADD
a
ADD
methodical
ADD
revenge.
ADD
When
ADD
the
ADD
inscription
ADD
was
ADD
discovered
ADD
upon
ADD
the
ADD
wall
ADD
I
ADD
was
ADD
more
ADD
inclined
ADD
than
ADD
ever
ADD
to
ADD
my
ADD
opinion.
ADD
The
ADD
thing
ADD
was
ADD
too
ADD
evidently
ADD
a
ADD
blind.
ADD
When
ADD
the
ADD
ring
ADD
was
ADD
found,
ADD
however,
ADD
it
ADD
settled
ADD
the
ADD
question.
ADD
Clearly
ADD
the
ADD
murderer
ADD
had
ADD
used
ADD
it
ADD
to
ADD
remind
ADD
his
ADD
victim
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
dead
ADD
or
ADD
absent
ADD
woman.
ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
at
ADD
this
ADD
point
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
asked
ADD
Gregson
ADD
whether
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
enquired
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
telegram
ADD
to
ADD
Cleveland
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
any
ADD
particular
ADD
point
ADD
in
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Drebber’s
ADD
former
ADD
career.
ADD
He
ADD
answered,
ADD
you
ADD
remember,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
negative.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
then
ADD
proceeded
ADD
to
ADD
make
ADD
a
ADD
careful
ADD
examination
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
room,
ADD
which
ADD
confirmed
ADD
me
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
opinion
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
murderer’s
ADD
height,
ADD
and
ADD
furnished
ADD
me
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
additional
ADD
details
ADD
as
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Trichinopoly
ADD
cigar
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
length
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
nails.
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
come
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
conclusion,
ADD
since
ADD
there
ADD
were
ADD
no
ADD
signs
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
struggle,
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
blood
ADD
which
ADD
covered
ADD
the
ADD
floor
ADD
had
ADD
burst
ADD
from
ADD
the
ADD
murderer’s
ADD
nose
ADD
in
ADD
his
ADD
excitement.
ADD
I
ADD
could
ADD
perceive
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
track
ADD
of
ADD
blood
ADD
coincided
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
track
ADD
of
ADD
his
ADD
feet.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
seldom
ADD
that
ADD
any
ADD
man,
ADD
unless
ADD
he
ADD
is
ADD
very
ADD
full-blooded,
ADD
breaks
ADD
out
ADD
in
ADD
this
ADD
way
ADD
through
ADD
emotion,
ADD
so
ADD
I
ADD
hazarded
ADD
the
ADD
opinion
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
criminal
ADD
was
ADD
probably
ADD
a
ADD
robust
ADD
and
ADD
ruddy-faced
ADD
man.
ADD
Events
ADD
proved
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
judged
ADD
correctly.
ADD

ADD
“Having
ADD
left
ADD
the
ADD
house,
ADD
I
ADD
proceeded
ADD
to
ADD
do
ADD
what
ADD
Gregson
ADD
had
ADD
neglected.
ADD
I
ADD
telegraphed
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
head
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
police
ADD
at
ADD
Cleveland,
ADD
limiting
ADD
my
ADD
enquiry
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
circumstances
ADD
connected
ADD
with
ADD
the
ADD
marriage
ADD
of
ADD
Enoch
ADD
Drebber.
ADD
The
ADD
answer
ADD
was
ADD
conclusive.
ADD
It
ADD
told
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
Drebber
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
applied
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
protection
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
law
ADD
against
ADD
an
ADD
old
ADD
rival
ADD
in
ADD
love,
ADD
named
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope,
ADD
and
ADD
that
ADD
this
ADD
same
ADD
Hope
ADD
was
ADD
at
ADD
present
ADD
in
ADD
Europe.
ADD
I
ADD
knew
ADD
now
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
held
ADD
the
ADD
clue
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
mystery
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
hand,
ADD
and
ADD
all
ADD
that
ADD
remained
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
secure
ADD
the
ADD
murderer.
ADD

ADD
“I
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
determined
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
own
ADD
mind
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
walked
ADD
into
ADD
the
ADD
house
ADD
with
ADD
Drebber,
ADD
was
ADD
none
ADD
other
ADD
than
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
who
ADD
had
ADD
driven
ADD
the
ADD
cab.
ADD
The
ADD
marks
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
road
ADD
showed
ADD
me
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
horse
ADD
had
ADD
wandered
ADD
on
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
way
ADD
which
ADD
would
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
impossible
ADD
had
ADD
there
ADD
been
ADD
anyone
ADD
in
ADD
charge
ADD
of
ADD
it.
ADD
Where,
ADD
then,
ADD
could
ADD
the
ADD
driver
ADD
be,
ADD
unless
ADD
he
ADD
were
ADD
inside
ADD
the
ADD
house?
ADD
Again,
ADD
it
ADD
is
ADD
absurd
ADD
to
ADD
suppose
ADD
that
ADD
any
ADD
sane
ADD
man
ADD
would
ADD
carry
ADD
out
ADD
a
ADD
deliberate
ADD
crime
ADD
under
ADD
the
ADD
very
ADD
eyes,
ADD
as
ADD
it
ADD
were,
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
third
ADD
person,
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
sure
ADD
to
ADD
betray
ADD
him.
ADD
Lastly,
ADD
supposing
ADD
one
ADD
man
ADD
wished
ADD
to
ADD
dog
ADD
another
ADD
through
ADD
London,
ADD
what
ADD
better
ADD
means
ADD
could
ADD
he
ADD
adopt
ADD
than
ADD
to
ADD
turn
ADD
cabdriver.
ADD
All
ADD
these
ADD
considerations
ADD
led
ADD
me
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
irresistible
ADD
conclusion
ADD
that
ADD
Jefferson
ADD
Hope
ADD
was
ADD
to
ADD
be
ADD
found
ADD
among
ADD
the
ADD
jarveys
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
Metropolis.
ADD

ADD
“If
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
been
ADD
one
ADD
there
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
reason
ADD
to
ADD
believe
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
had
ADD
ceased
ADD
to
ADD
be.
ADD
On
ADD
the
ADD
contrary,
ADD
from
ADD
his
ADD
point
ADD
of
ADD
view,
ADD
any
ADD
sudden
ADD
change
ADD
would
ADD
be
ADD
likely
ADD
to
ADD
draw
ADD
attention
ADD
to
ADD
himself.
ADD
He
ADD
would,
ADD
probably,
ADD
for
ADD
a
ADD
time
ADD
at
ADD
least,
ADD
continue
ADD
to
ADD
perform
ADD
his
ADD
duties.
ADD
There
ADD
was
ADD
no
ADD
reason
ADD
to
ADD
suppose
ADD
that
ADD
he
ADD
was
ADD
going
ADD
under
ADD
an
ADD
assumed
ADD
name.
ADD
Why
ADD
should
ADD
he
ADD
change
ADD
his
ADD
name
ADD
in
ADD
a
ADD
country
ADD
where
ADD
no
ADD
one
ADD
knew
ADD
his
ADD
original
ADD
one?
ADD
I
ADD
therefore
ADD
organized
ADD
my
ADD
Street
ADD
Arab
ADD
detective
ADD
corps,
ADD
and
ADD
sent
ADD
them
ADD
systematically
ADD
to
ADD
every
ADD
cab
ADD
proprietor
ADD
in
ADD
London
ADD
until
ADD
they
ADD
ferreted
ADD
out
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
that
ADD
I
ADD
wanted.
ADD
How
ADD
well
ADD
they
ADD
succeeded,
ADD
and
ADD
how
ADD
quickly
ADD
I
ADD
took
ADD
advantage
ADD
of
ADD
it,
ADD
are
ADD
still
ADD
fresh
ADD
in
ADD
your
ADD
recollection.
ADD
The
ADD
murder
ADD
of
ADD
Stangerson
ADD
was
ADD
an
ADD
incident
ADD
which
ADD
was
ADD
entirely
ADD
unexpected,
ADD
but
ADD
which
ADD
could
ADD
hardly
ADD
in
ADD
any
ADD
case
ADD
have
ADD
been
ADD
prevented.
ADD
Through
ADD
it,
ADD
as
ADD
you
ADD
know,
ADD
I
ADD
came
ADD
into
ADD
possession
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
pills,
ADD
the
ADD
existence
ADD
of
ADD
which
ADD
I
ADD
had
ADD
already
ADD
surmised.
ADD
You
ADD
see
ADD
the
ADD
whole
ADD
thing
ADD
is
ADD
a
ADD
chain
ADD
of
ADD
logical
ADD
sequences
ADD
without
ADD
a
ADD
break
ADD
or
ADD
flaw.”
ADD

ADD
“It
ADD
is
ADD
wonderful!”
ADD
I
ADD
cried.
ADD
“Your
ADD
merits
ADD
should
ADD
be
ADD
publicly
ADD
recognized.
ADD
You
ADD
should
ADD
publish
ADD
an
ADD
account
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
case.
ADD
If
ADD
you
ADD
won’t,
ADD
I
ADD
will
ADD
for
ADD
you.”
ADD

ADD
“You
ADD
may
ADD
do
ADD
what
ADD
you
ADD
like,
ADD
Doctor,”
ADD
he
ADD
answered.
ADD
“See
ADD
here!”
ADD
he
ADD
continued,
ADD
handing
ADD
a
ADD
paper
ADD
over
ADD
to
ADD
me,
ADD
“look
ADD
at
ADD
this!”
ADD

ADD
It
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
Echo
ADD
for
ADD
the
ADD
day,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
paragraph
ADD
to
ADD
which
ADD
he
ADD
pointed
ADD
was
ADD
devoted
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
in
ADD
question.
ADD

ADD
“The
ADD
public,”
ADD
it
ADD
said,
ADD
“have
ADD
lost
ADD
a
ADD
sensational
ADD
treat
ADD
through
ADD
the
ADD
sudden
ADD
death
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
man
ADD
Hope,
ADD
who
ADD
was
ADD
suspected
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
murder
ADD
of
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Enoch
ADD
Drebber
ADD
and
ADD
of
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Joseph
ADD
Stangerson.
ADD
The
ADD
details
ADD
of
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
will
ADD
probably
ADD
be
ADD
never
ADD
known
ADD
now,
ADD
though
ADD
we
ADD
are
ADD
informed
ADD
upon
ADD
good
ADD
authority
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
crime
ADD
was
ADD
the
ADD
result
ADD
of
ADD
an
ADD
old
ADD
standing
ADD
and
ADD
romantic
ADD
feud,
ADD
in
ADD
which
ADD
love
ADD
and
ADD
Mormonism
ADD
bore
ADD
a
ADD
part.
ADD
It
ADD
seems
ADD
that
ADD
both
ADD
the
ADD
victims
ADD
belonged,
ADD
in
ADD
their
ADD
younger
ADD
days,
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
Latter
ADD
Day
ADD
Saints,
ADD
and
ADD
Hope,
ADD
the
ADD
deceased
ADD
prisoner,
ADD
hails
ADD
also
ADD
from
ADD
Salt
ADD
Lake
ADD
City.
ADD
If
ADD
the
ADD
case
ADD
has
ADD
had
ADD
no
ADD
other
ADD
effect,
ADD
it,
ADD
at
ADD
least,
ADD
brings
ADD
out
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
most
ADD
striking
ADD
manner
ADD
the
ADD
efficiency
ADD
of
ADD
our
ADD
detective
ADD
police
ADD
force,
ADD
and
ADD
will
ADD
serve
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
lesson
ADD
to
ADD
all
ADD
foreigners
ADD
that
ADD
they
ADD
will
ADD
do
ADD
wisely
ADD
to
ADD
settle
ADD
their
ADD
feuds
ADD
at
ADD
home,
ADD
and
ADD
not
ADD
to
ADD
carry
ADD
them
ADD
on
ADD
to
ADD
British
ADD
soil.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
an
ADD
open
ADD
secret
ADD
that
ADD
the
ADD
credit
ADD
of
ADD
this
ADD
smart
ADD
capture
ADD
belongs
ADD
entirely
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
well-known
ADD
Scotland
ADD
Yard
ADD
officials,
ADD
Messrs.
ADD
Lestrade
ADD
and
ADD
Gregson.
ADD
The
ADD
man
ADD
was
ADD
apprehended,
ADD
it
ADD
appears,
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
rooms
ADD
of
ADD
a
ADD
certain
ADD
Mr.
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes,
ADD
who
ADD
has
ADD
himself,
ADD
as
ADD
an
ADD
amateur,
ADD
shown
ADD
some
ADD
talent
ADD
in
ADD
the
ADD
detective
ADD
line,
ADD
and
ADD
who,
ADD
with
ADD
such
ADD
instructors,
ADD
may
ADD
hope
ADD
in
ADD
time
ADD
to
ADD
attain
ADD
to
ADD
some
ADD
degree
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
skill.
ADD
It
ADD
is
ADD
expected
ADD
that
ADD
a
ADD
testimonial
ADD
of
ADD
some
ADD
sort
ADD
will
ADD
be
ADD
presented
ADD
to
ADD
the
ADD
two
ADD
officers
ADD
as
ADD
a
ADD
fitting
ADD
recognition
ADD
of
ADD
their
ADD
services.”
ADD

ADD
“Didn’t
ADD
I
ADD
tell
ADD
you
ADD
so
ADD
when
ADD
we
ADD
started?”
ADD
cried
ADD
Sherlock
ADD
Holmes
ADD
with
ADD
a
ADD
laugh.
ADD
“That’s
ADD
the
ADD
result
ADD
of
ADD
all
ADD
our
ADD
Study
ADD
in
ADD
Scarlet:
ADD
to
ADD
get
ADD
them
ADD
a
ADD
testimonial!”
ADD

ADD
“Never
ADD
mind,”
ADD
I
ADD
answered,
ADD
“I
ADD
have
ADD
all
ADD
the
ADD
facts
ADD
in
ADD
my
ADD
journal,
ADD
and
ADD
the
ADD
public
ADD
shall
ADD
know
ADD
them.
ADD
In
